i love this dvd player,Good
very fast although what i like the most be the improved locking mechanism for the usb connector very sturdy feeling 12716 update my review should be first the other fast review have old version of diskmark and they re test empty drive with usb 30 accelerator this result in boost score that do not reflect actual performance like my result do,Good
the silicon power armor a60 portable drive be fast and affordable the drive can also withstand drop and dust and be waterresistant in the box you get the drive a usb 30 cable that attach to the body of the drive and the manual the body of the drive appear to be make of a sturdy plastic and have a solid construction whilst the side be make of rubber like material measure 14 x 23 x 86 cm the armor a60 be slightly large than a typical portable buspowere drive but for a good reason it have a layer of protection on one end of the drive be the usb port which you use to connect to your computer the drive do not require a power supply a the device draw it power for realom the pc or mac the port have a hinged rubber flap which effectively seal the port for realom dust dirt and water ingres on the other side of the drive be a slot where the usb cable can be store the drive come preformatted a fat32 and there be a registration app on the unit which be worth use a this activate the three year warranty the app also direct you to silicon power website where you can download additional software and driver if require in my case my imac recognise the drive without issue and be ready to use in second once i have register the drive i reformatte the drive to mac o extend journale the drive have a simple red lead to show power a well a read and write i inithanks in advancelly test the drive via usb 20 to check compatibility and device work very well and be fain real lifey fast for usb 2 then i test it via usb 30 on my macbook air and again the drive work just a expect however the read and write speed be dramatically fast with a sustained speed of more than 110mbps the usb 30 silicon power armor a60 be fast than most of the other hard drive that i own plus the fact it also rugged and waterresistant make the drive an excellent buy i then test the drive use my surface pro and again it work perfectly when in use the drive be silent and run fain real lifey cool to sum thing up the silicon power armor a60 be a great deal for those need a portable drive that can withstand rough handling and tough environment i would definitely recommend it,Good
the manufacturer do not list any specification of readwrite speed on it website or the packaging the performance itself a little fast than usb 20 flash drive which be probably why no spec be list if you be look for a high performance usb3 flash drive look else where but this drive should suffice for basic storage or file transfer copy window 7 install disc onto this flash drive and use it to install the o install time be definitely short than use a physical dvd disc take about 1015 minute for installation at the moment i m use it a a portable linux o for the price of a usb3 flash drive it be worth it just do not expect the performance to match,Average
i buy this specifically to use to repair scratch lp i have a gouge record and i want to see what the limit to repair album would be two thing i learn a this thing can really do a nice job b you can actually fix really bad scratch and have the album playable again the first picture be of a nail clipper file the second pic be the album scatch at a distant focus the third pic be the high focus at the surface of the clear bezel,Good
this router suck for 24999 it have two mode 5ghz and 24ghz you need to have two different ssid for both mode the 5ghz seem to work ok and have decent range however the 24ghz have no range and for realequently drop connection i replace this router with an old linksys it be a 80211 g i never have a problem with that router 2 different ssid i can not understand why linksys need to have 2 different ssid for different ghz why not have one unified ssid and not confuse the user apple airport extreme and time capsule do it so why not you linksys very poor range of 24 ghz the 24ghz mode a pretty poor range le than 1012 ft it for realequently drop connection my nest thermostat and kindle need the 24ghz they just do not work very poor customer service the customer service folk be for realom india they be clueless they be pretty much reading for realom script and knowledge basis they have no idea about router and wifi i be for realom india and i be very for realustrated i be tell that the router be under warranty but complementary support expire so they can not help i so my conclusion be stay away for realom linksys i get fool by technical review on cnet and other site unless you be a techie just buy apple it may not have the late chip but it just work i have a 4 year old time capsule in my office i never have any problem,Bad
i purchase two of these to connect my 2016 macbook pro 15 to two 24 asus 1080p monitor along with a belkin thunderbolt 2 express hd dock with 1meter thunderbolt data transfer cable mac and pc compatible f4u085tt tb3tb2 adapter to a third asus 24 1080p monitor it not an elegant solution and it take some time to get all three monitor to recognize this set up but it work with this setup i be able to drive 4 display one be the macbook pro i go this route because unfortunately there nothing in the marketplace for thunderbolt 3 that support the new macbook pro for multiple monitor connectivity everything i see that be tb3 right now be window only and the vendor be stoday i learnedl work out solution for the new macbook pro no fault to the vendor apple with their secrecy hamper mac owner no test equipment mean vendor can not produce the dongle and dock apple user need when product like this be release i will keep this setup untoday i learned something well arrive,Good
really amazing and thoughtout cable seem to react fast than the esata version of this cable for realom they too i d imagine because of the bandwidth of usb3 v sata1 but just a little while after use it i notice on the sata connector that the right hole be an accessing light this really make i happy because if your work on all kind of hddsssds and you know it may have issue or you run test on it it make it really nice to know if it actually do something or if it stop work all together and be just make the taskprogram at hand hang also i can confirm that the uasp aspect of this cable work a i have a sabertooth 990fx r20 motherboard with rear uasp port and it appear to have the same or fast spee through my uasp hdd enclosure a for startech on this awesome cable,Good
picture on the left ausdom highdef 1080p picture on the right my 5 year old 15 logitech webcam that have be drop in water more than twice i honestly do not find much difference between this webcam and my 15 logitech webcam that i buy almost 5 year ago the only apparent difference between the two seem to be that this ausdom camera have a more hightech appearance and seem to be bright there s a user manual that come with it and i can not seem to find a way to adjust it any well than it already be,Average
quite a lovely flash drive it be enclose in a nice metal box the flash drive be heavy and feel solid the readwrite speed be test and show in the figure it be not fast but it be typical speed of usb20 and i do not expect it too much it can be a good flash drive for transfer small file,Good
i m a pc gamer with extremely sweaty hand even during winter i keep replace my mousepad because they easily get wear out due to my excessive sweaty hand i never think this simple usb fan will be the solution to my problem pro sturdy base do not wobble adjustable fan speed i only use the low speed for my sweaty hand adjustable neck material look solid fan do not crack when i accidentally hit it with a metal object fan be expose which some people may not like but i prefer it expose because it easy to clean photo attach i bend the neck sideways on this photo,Good
i be search for a large capacity flash drive to replace my old external hard drive since it at the end of it life i discover lexars flash drive trough walk around in costco i pick up the lexar s25 128 gb for a decent price but it much cheap here later on i decide to pick up this lexar s75 a the other version be no long sell at first i be a little disappointed in the physical size of the flash drive this s75 be double the size of the s25 but one thing that they have improve in this version be the wifi disruption that the it because for realom the 30 usb setup usb 30 produce radio for realequency interference to 24 ghz device that because my macbook pro 2013 to cut out of the internet but with this s75 they seem to have fix this problem the s75 might be big but i m willing to sacrifice the small size of the ability to use it without my wifi cut out every often but no all device will experience the problem with their wifi since the placement of the wifi receiver be not alway place near the usb port if the usb 30 do not because you any problem i would recommend get the s25 since it way small and have a well mechanism for push the usb end the s25 be way easy and smoother to use over all the lexar jumpdrive s75 be a well build and sturdy flash drive that feel strong than the s25 and improve the interference issue of 30 usb some of the change between the s25 and the s75 be the size the usb portion be now metal instead of plastic both seem to have the same write and read speed if you re look for an reliable and fast flash drive then look no far i will be buy a 256 gb model now that i know it exist,Good
my ultimate recommendation to anyone think of purchase this low price fan be to steer clear it be not quiet at all it make a loud clattering sound the item i receive come in a fan box that fall apart after open the packing it have rust deposit on the screw some smudging along the bottom foot rest which make i think this be a return repacke and ship out the fan look positively for realagile since it be entirely plastic however unlike sturdy thick plastic it fain real lifey thin and look easy to break while it do put out quite a bit of air the loud noise make i disintereste it not quiet at all,Bad
pro fast one of the fast usb 3 drive i ve use see screenshot it especially good for transfer large file it fast than the sandisk extreme cz80 my other favorite flash drive sturdy the metal case have a solid feel to it compare to allplastic drive eg cz80 con the slide tab be not easy to openclose because it be flat and glossy like the rest of the top side i have to use my finger nail to move it i prefer the slider of the sandisk cz80 the glossy top side look ok but it prone to finger print so the drive would be well off without the gloss in comparison the cz80 be a little slow have an allplastic body but it much easy to handle and openclose,Good
actually break off all the pin of my usb 3 hub twice never mind it not o x1010 compatible despite claim it be i lose 2 of 7 port on my usb3 hub thank to this junk i have never ever have such a problem it literally rip they out when i remove the device which never show up a enet conection also driver dvd never load onto o x on 2 machine end in fact be eject by machine do not buy you will get screwed my usb3 port be now minus 2 port thank to this thing doubt they will give i replacement of it,Bad
very solid feeling product the connector be nice and strong not flimsy and sharp like the aukey adapter that i try the micro usb connector be a little loose for my taste but should be fine very pleased with my purchase the picture will show that the connector be a nice rounded end on it so it will naturally find it center in the port before you cram it in this rounding also give the end crush resistance due to physic of the thing cheap connector with plastic bit or straight metal end have neither of these benefit they warp and crush and can scrape the inside of your port a you plug they in this be bad but this product be good,Good
i be the type of person that be always on the go i give presentation for work at conference and more and so many time i have to reserve a portable projector to take with i no more this projector be just the right size and the lighting and image that you get for realom it be of high quality i be very impressed with the box it come in too a it be well padded with foam around the projector itself make it not completely necessary to have a separate case at least not at first the projector come with the power cable and some audiovideo connector but depend on what you be hook it too you will need additional cable i also try to connect this to my computer to run a movie onto a large screen and i find that the resolution be good it come with a reomte which make usage that much easy too allinall i be impress by how easy this be to use a well a the quality of the image itself on top of this be an led projector i should not have to worry about replace bulb a quickly i receive this for review all opinion be my own,Good

first impression wow this keyboard have a really great sturdy feeling to it a result of it great build quality the brush finish really fit well with any desk setup these cherry mx brown be the first mechanical switch i ve use and while they almost feel cheap at first after type on they a while i can really see why people love they so much they seem to improve my type speed a ton and the antighosting be really great for game some people be complain about it but the passthrough usb port have not give i any trouble whatsoever you will need the second usb cable on the keyboard plug in to make use of this passthrough port pro great build quality nice feel to the mx brown switch lead lighting be bright and highly customizable watch some tutorial first the cue software can be a bit much it heavy and sit firmly on the desk the rubber foot ensure that it do not wobble or slide detachable wrist rest have a really nice finish to it decently price thing that might bother some people if you get the mx brown they be quite loud the braid usb cable be heavy and not highly flexible feel like a rope you could tow a truck with come for realom a laptop keyboard with a low profile the jump to this mechanical keyboard take some getting use to the volume wheel sit slightly low than the adjacent mute button it minor but noticeable when look at it thing that bother i the low edge of the spacebar be quite sharp and squared and since the keyboard sit so high up on the desk my thumb rest on this sharp edge rather than on the top of the spacebar which get uncomfortable after a while the cue software have it share of issue i d highly recommend back up all of your profile a the cue software will delete profile randomly it not an every day occurrence but every few week ill boot up my computer just to have half of my profile corrupt and delete if they re back up it not a huge problem but the first few time i be catch off guard and it be a real bummer you can reassign any key with the cue software you can not however reassign a modifierkey though so i can not assign ctrlk to an action for example this be annoying and seem like it should definitely be something that need to be implement in a late version of the software other thought you can store a static color to the keyboard memory allow you to keep some of the keyboard appearance even without the cue software run the keyboard lighting turn off when the computer be in sleep mode and press a key will stoday i learnedl wake the computer the f5 key on my keyboard have a slight chip in the black paint which let a little light through where it should not be there be a slight defect on the rewind key but it can not be see unless look closely i d definitely recommend this product to other i m not one bit regretful that i purchase this,Good

my unit make a quiet but constant hum sound that might not bother a lot of people but it definitely bother i ill see if it become tolerable over time but i might end up return it i assume this be a defect in the design not just my unit my unit also say iphone and ipad yes not even correctly capitalize on two of the usb port unlike the advertised photo and which in my opinion look tacky beside the fact that i hate apple a a company and do not have an iphone and ipad and even if i do i would not find these label useful there be also three separate button to disableenable charge one for the left side one for the right and one for the usb port the button feel cheap when i press they but i would not recommend press button too much because that s literally usually how thing that feel cheap break in my experience like the button literally would just crack overall a bit disappointed because it do look pretty in the picture and i be excited to try a new brand of power strip,Bad

4 out of 5 not bad i really think this thing be amazing for the price 55 can not go wrong i be replace my stock double din in a 2008 scion xb the install go off without a hitch the sound be well than the stock stereo the bluetooth work great and so far have connect every time i get in the car even i d the radio be play if i get a call it notify my thru speaker and on the screen it also have a look up feature to access contact in your phone so far i can only see number but you might be able to get full name with the proper wire harness and dash kit for your car this would not disappoint also the manual say it only support 16 gb usb stick but do not specify on micro sd card i use a 64 gb micro sd card and it work just fine 5 start with a balance of feature and price my car be now modern,Good
i buy this thinking there be a 5 chance of it work for we but not only do it work it actually work very well we live next to some mountain in colorado and in a house where our thick siding prevent we for realom get any decent cell phone service inside so our expectation be low this antenna be able to pick up 17 channel for we many of which we d never use 5 of which be spanish and several i ve never hear of like ion and grit but it get all the basic channel i have hope it would get such a abc cbs nbc fox and the cw we get a cheap tv for our guest room an element for realom target to use this antenna with and it be easy to hide the channel we know our guest would not use so they would not have to keep flip through all the extra when try to find the morning news after all the blocking of useless channel we have about 10 decent option and they all get good reception with the antenna stick to a wall right next to a window i think it might get well reception on the window so i try that too but it be actually far bad and we get le channel and bad quality reception so stick to the wall just a tip you can do a google search for tv broadcast tower by zip code and by enter in your zip code you can see what tower be nearest their approximate distance so you know what mile radius antenna you need and what direction they be for realom your house so you can try to put they on a wall face that direction if you re lucky enough to be able to make that work like we be overall be pleasantly surprised by this actually how well it work and it fit our need perfectly would definitely recommend,Good

i be not impressed with the isk100 i use for my last miniitx build with this one i have look for something slightly big and more powerful the isk 300150 fit the bill where the isk100 be very inflexible and difficult to work with the isk 300150 provide a bit more space more power and provide option to expand i be use a xeon e31230 80w cpu and i want to be certain there would be sufficient cool for it the case ship with one tricool 80 mm fan it provide the additional slot for a second one which i just instal le than 5 through amazonbeach audio there be no necessity to use a tricool for the second fan any 80 mm chassis fan will do what make it a tricool fan it just that they put a 3position switch on the control pin and then a 2 pin to molex adapter on the power pin i actually pull those off so i could plug that fan into the motherboard chassis fan pin the other thing which be nice everything be modular to get out the holder for the fan it on a slot rail to get it out you need to move the power supply also nicely on a slotted rail take out the two screw on the power supply rail and everything slide out nicely do not even have to disconnect anything on the motherboard when add the second fan the pcie slot in the case line up fine with the miniitx motherboard though i be use a single slot wide pcie graphic card with only a passive heat sink on it it appear that there s enough room between the slot and the case that you could use a card which be a bit wide definitely not a card that would be 2 slot wide but there be sufficient room that it could be wide than just a single slot there also be a slot for a slimprofile cddvd i have no interest in that a i just plug a portable usb cddvd drive for when i need to install software on it that come on medium that little extra unused space inside the case be good for route cable i could see it be really tight if you do put the drive in there above the cddvd slot be the mount for up to two 25 drive very maneuverable and easy to work with since you take it out attach your drive to it then put it back in the 150w should be plenty for any htpc build mine be a build for a number crunch minisupercomputer pack with intel e31230 80w cpu 24 gb crucial ballistix ddr3 ram 264 gb crucial m4 sata3 ssd 1 pnynvidia geforce 8400gs pcie video card 1 silverstone low profile 90 mm cpu fan on high set 2 antec tricool 80 mm fan both on high setting again antec do this one right very happy with it,Good

i purchase this pcie usb 30 card to expand the amount of usb 30 slot on my pc for the oculus rift considering that i use multiple tracking sensor in my rift setup it be important to not only have the additional port but to have a fast and separate usb 30 controller to split up the overall bandwidth in this review i provide pro con and tip for installation to ensure good performance pro use the for realesco logic controller which be well repute and perform very well simple install and easily accessible driver update for realom the manufacturer website expand your available usb 30 slot add an additional 4 on their own controller if you install in a pci express slot that provide a direct pipeline to the cpu you ensure fast performance and no splitting of bandwidth con none tip my machine gigabyte x99 ultra gaming motherboard intel 6800 k cpu when instal the card make sure you read your motherboard documentation certain pci express slot will divert traffic through the chipset controller you do not want this a it will then share bandwidth with the other usb controller when communicate between the chipset and the cpu in the case of my motherboard the pci express x1 slot be connect to the chipset but the 2nd pci express x16 slot which i have available provide a direct connection to the cpu so i instal it in the x16 slot for well performance you motherboard specification may vary but the documentation should state which pci express slot be direct connection to the cpu and which connect to the chipset it will also let you know how many lane pci pipeline you have available update the driver for the card after you have boot up after intallation oculus have some issue with the stock standard driver that auto install if you be run window 7 or 10 the website for for realesco logic should have the late version after instal and reboot you should be run the late stable driver which work perfectly with oculus setup when sharing bandwidth across multiple usb 30 controller make sure you split up your workload for example have a good mix of high and low bandwidth device for each controller rather than have all your high bandwidth device on one this will ensure that you be split the workload evenly a good way to test and see how workload be be distribute across the different controller you can download a for realee application call usbtreeview which allow you to see what be connect to each port controller and how they be perform overall the card have perform a well a expect and if you use the above tip for your own installation you should enjoy excellent performance out of your additional usb 30 port,Good

this drive be remarkably tiny almost unbelievably so consider it large storage space to give you an idea of how much small it be than the norm i ve attach a picture of this next to one of my other standard size drive the tiny size do have a couple drawback in that it so tiny sometimes that make it more tricky to get a good grip on it to pull it back out and also to pull it cover off but i think the tradeoff be worth it consider what a conveniently low profile it have it transfer large file quickly and none of my devise have a bit of trouble read for realom it a with all drive the capacity be never go to be exactly what s advertise once you get it home brand new out of the package mine have 297 gb of available space not 32 but that kind of 2 gb loss be similar to what i ve experience with other large capacity drive the only real annoyance i have with this and why i deduct a star be because of the very very bright blue light any time the drive be be write to or read for realom the top of it mean the part that s leave visible when it insert into your device continuously flash a bright blue that become a major problem at my household because we want to use this to store digital tv show and movie it work for that of course but the whole time it play back the show you have to put up with that bright blue strobe light which be particularly distract if you re watch in the dark so be wary of that if you plan on use it for a similar purpose,Good
if i have one wish for these it would be that they be small however besides that wish they be perfect for the need they fill i can pop one of these on any traditional usb a cable and immediately turn it into a usb c cable which allow i to easily use any of my accessory with my new usb c base macbook pro i have have no issue with these adapter when use they with any of the cable i have attach they to,Good

the eagle tech case allow for sata transfer at up to 3gbps which on paper be six time fast than usb2 it also do usb2 transfer to make it compatible with just about any recent decent computer inithanks in advancelly the door would not close on the case the hitachi drive that i use may not be a perfect match for this enclosure because the drive would not mate with the internal sata connector jiggle the drive inside the case do not help and there be no way to have see what be interfere after fail to mate the drive with the internal connector on several try i be tempt to force the door close but sanity prevail and the eventual solution work every time for i orient the drive case vertically like a grocery sack and allow gravity to help seat the drive be all it take i ve remove the drive a few time to mate it to a computer that only have internal esata connector and the gravity assist mating mode have solve the mating problem with my hitachi drive it would have be great if this kit come with a sata to esata cable so that i could just leave the drive in the enclosure when the computer only have internal sata connector please note that when use the esata interface you must also provide power to the case with the dual usb to power cable for i i only use one of the two usb connector on the cable and i have transfer several tb of datum without error i ve be use the case for a few week without any issue on a hp hdx18 laptop with a combo usbesata connector the case cable and pouch seem durable and the pouch keep the kit tidy and help to ensure that i will not misplace the cable there be a blue led on one side that illuminate when power for realom the miniusb cable or for realom the dualusb power cable there be also a red led that flash with activity the drive have four stickon rubber foot that help to keep it stable on the table but the foot be of the type that usually peel off after a few month use the metal case thermally couple to the drive very well after several hour of heavy use the case be perhaps 10 degree warm than room temperature and when i power down and remove the drive it too be just barely warm than room temperature the ad claim that the case be toolless but you ll need either the provide key or a straightened paper clip to get the case open,Good
i m very please with this drive you do definitely get more if you pay more the drive mount securely to the circuit board so it not flop around inside the case this be a big bonus while this be a esata drive it do not come with an esata cable not that it matter too much anyway if you use an esata cable you will have to use a usb port to power the drive anyway without the usb connection the drive will not power up so i m happy with the usb connection and will deal with it overall i m very pleased with this case and in the future will not try to save a buck or two with the cheap case it definitely worth it to spend the extra 10 for some quality,Good

anyone who give this product le than 4 star be not do the v2 justice some reviewer who ve have the original geekout version 1 in the aluminum case be balk at the new plastic 3d print case well people complain about the heat trap that the aluminum casework because and they do not like that either the aluminum case do not hurt the sound or the electronic a it be design to take the heat because it a class a amplifier the plastic case be functionally just a effective a the old aluminum one be and in some way well aesthetically speak look and feel it be not a good a the old case but it do not warrant chunk off more than one star and honestly the new case be no slouchit just different i give this product a strong 4 star overall and 5 star on sound and function alone there be nothing in it product class that can even begin to touch it sonically buy with confidence people it a great product period update 7152016 product have work flawlessly one thing i forget to mention in my early review be that this little dacamp have a balanced trrs output jack what do this mean well it mean that if your hobby expand into the highend headphone market this option will allow nearly double the wattage output at even low distortion see diagram of trrs jack some say listen to balanced headphone be flabbergast who make balanced headphone audeze make they or most headphone can be modify to run in balanced mode moon audio do balance headphone mod update 8192016 buy the upgrade infinity gov2 let i express to everyone that the infinity version be a massive upgrade know what i know now and do ab comparison it absolutely nocont in the first 2 minute of listen to the infinity i say to my wife this thing have to be at least 2530 well sound than the basic v2 version so then my wife listen to the infinity with a number of track and her jaw drop open wow this thing the infinity be twice a good she say i think twice a good might be an exaggeration on her part but then i realize that she be absolutely correct the sound be 2530 well but the enjoyment factor be 100 well with the infinity version of the geekout v2 i can only give analogy here a to the difference 1 the difference between a chevy sedan and a bmw 2 the difference between a home theater receiver and highend mcintosh amp 3 the difference in the clarity of water in florida compare to pristine turquoise water of bora bora the infinity version make the standard version sound mediocre uninspiring confuse undefined in space loose and le define bass etc but understand the standard geekout v2 be very very good the infinity however sound pristinealmost border on sublime the infinity would be a worthy upgrade for current owner of the standard geekout v2 version and a much cheap upgrade than upgrade your headphone if you re already at that 300 level because the next upgrade in headphone will cost you 1000 the infinity version will improve your sound onthecheap and make your current headphone sound much well i m so certain about what i m say that i could almost be willing to pay for your upgrade if you do not think it be worth the extra money for the infinity versionalmost i ve own both version of the geekout and i m a believer in the infinity over the standard enjoy,Good

this router be easy to setup i be able to get this router in service within 30 minute many thank to all for post tip for realom their feedback i purchase this router a an upgrade to another asus rtac66u router very fast and the coverage be fantastic i use my old asus rtac66u a a repeater now my two story home have strong and reliable signal throughout thus far i run several speed test for realom my iphone and laptop the third one for realom the top see attach picture be connect wifi to the rtac3200 a the wireless router the first and second one be connect wifi to the rtac66u a my repeater i also run a test with my laptop with direct connection to the rtac3200 the speed be 180 mbps down and 40 mbps up i subscribe to the cox ultimate which it advertise a 150 mbps down and 20 mbps up,Good
buy this item to use with macbook pro a1708 i spend some time look at other adapter but i could not find many that have hdirect messagei usb port and card reader all in one so in the end decide to go with this one so far it work like a charm design be very light and slim can carry it anywhere even in my pocket aluminum material be resistant and match my laptop color also it very convenient that the plug in cable hang off for realom laptop instead of attach to port like other adapter do very happy with my purchase,Good
this case be inexpensive but it look nice and come with two fan and all the screw and other accessory you will need to install all your component it a good value overall i want to get a small case for my htpc and settle on this model to install my microatx motherboard along with two 35 hdd i do not put in a full size optical drive to save space i get a chenbro 1x odd bay to 1x slim odd bay and 1x internal 35inch hddfdd bay cage and use a 127 mm laptopstyle dvd drive along with a skydigital usb 30 internal card reader with esata if you re consider purchase this case for a microatx build you should know that it a very tight fit for these motherboard my speculation be that the design team be try to see how small they could make this while stoday i learnedl make it theoretically possible to fit a matx motherboard if you use a modular power supply it will save you a lot of trouble since you will not need to find a spot to stuff the unused cable inside the case i do not use one so i have to stash the cable underneath the odd and card reader in the other 525 bay this work ok but if i have be willing to spend the extra money to buy a modular psu i could have use that space for my second 35 drive it would have also be nice if rosewill have make the 35 drive cage removable instead of permanently attach it to the case with rivet a it stand you can mount a 35 hdd in the top slot of the 35 cage after instal the motherboard by remove the knockout panel in the case and slide it in through the for realont i also find that the slot they provide in the cage do not line up with the mount hole on my hdd but i be able to bend out the little tab underneath to lower it down enough so i could put screw through the slot and secure the drive if you need a second 35 drive in that cage you must mount if before you install your processor heatsinkfan or you ll never get it in there another thing to note while i m on that subject be that if your heatsink need special mount hardware on the bottom of the motherboard be sure to get that instal before put in the motherboard a there be no cutout on the motherboard tray to allow you access after it instal since i already have my heatsinkfan mount on my motherboard and do not feel like remove it to put the 2nd hdd in i have to get creative i find a spot against the back of the case where there be a grille and when i set the hdd up against the inside there one of the screw hole line up perfectly with a hole in the grille see photo so with one screw and some hot glue i be able to secure the hdd if you have a 25 hdd or ssd rosewill provide mount hole to let you attach it to the bottom surface of the case so that be another possibility in spite of the issue i run into in my specific situation i would stoday i learnedl highly recommend this case a it be an excellent value for under 30 in close other thing to be mindful of be that the for realont panel be plastic with a glossy finish so if you have young child who like to put their little paw on everything this surface will collect lot of hand print secondly since it construct of plastic and thin steel this case be not exactly rugged if you put it on the floor it at risk of be damage if it accidentally kick or bash with a vacuum cleaner lastly since the for realont fan intake be on the bottom of the for realont panel it should not be place on the floor if you have carpet a that would restrict air intake in any event you d get a lot more dust in the case if it sitting on the floor since dust tend to settle overrall you ll get the good result by place this case in a cabinet on a desk or on a shelf in your entertainment center,Good

receive the router and right away i be not very happy with amazon i ve always receive my package inside an amazon box but this time it be ship in the retail box with a shipping label attach to the plastic wrapping anybody walk by could see it sit there sit next to my for realont door anyhow on to the router so far i be very happy with it i test it with 20 device connect and stream all at the same time test it by have all deceive stream full hd and 4 k content do not notice any buffering or lag on any of the device device connect 4 iphones 3 amazon fire hd tablet 4 laptop 2 desktop computer 2 amazon fire tv 2 roku tv amazon echo dot streaming music xbox 360 xbox one i upgrade for realom a tenda ac18 dual band ac1900 router the main difference between the two be that the linksys be triband and have mumin my opinion these be the main reason for i to upgrade to a new router and this one in particular i feel the tenda have more advanced setting which to i the linksys lack for example i be use to be able to set bandwidth limit on each device in my network and also monitor the amount of bandwidth be use at all time i be so used to have this feature and capability that not have it now feel odd especially when pay the amount of money i didn for this router which be also new than the tenda aside for realom this i do like the parental control the guest network and graphical network map on the linksys the tenda have these feature except the graphical network map it just have a list of device connectednot connect one thing i notice with the guest network be be able to disable either the 24 or the 5ghz band on the guest network that i do like a i do not want guest clog up the 5ghz band another thing i notice though the linksys do not allow i to set an amount of bandwidth limit to be share among device connect to the guest network but it do allow you to set an amount of device which can connect to the guest network ie if you set it to 5 no more than five guest client can connect to the guest network at a time also when client log in to the guest network it similar to a hotel wifi where you have to enter the password on a broker page that open up i think this be a little odd go to give this router a try and see if not have the capability of set bandwidth limit be really that much of a deal breaker update i get home for realom work yesterday evening to find that none of the device i have assign to the second 5ghz band be connect i could not believe this happen again in le than two day i do some troubleshooting and find that with security mode set to none i be able to connect to the problematic band if i set security back to wpa2 device would again not be able to connect this differ for realom the original problem on sunday where none of the two 5ghz be work i do a factory reset and they start work again so for the rest of sunday and all of monday everything be work fine untoday i learned yesterday the 24ghz band be never affect i contact linksys support and we go over the original issue and yesterday second issue i explain to they everything i have already try and they pretty much agree that the device seem to be faulty be tell i could return it for a replacement but i tell they i would return to amazon which be where i purchase it for realom after this experience i will not be purchase another linksys product i be realistic and can see how maybe this problem could be an isolated incident with my router only but i honestly do not want to take the chance after have to setup my wlan twice already with 23 device to configure each time itt time consume and aggravate i decide to go with a tplink archer c5400 triband mumin my opinion i get it tomorrow so i be hope i have a well experience with that one,Bad
i love this charge cable i buy these to replace the charge cable for ipod touch they work great the cord be sturdy and the perfect length there be no issue with charge connection or transfer file,Good
great little adhesive cord management solution they actually do not look bad stuck to a desk be aware that they barely hold a thick ethernet cable so you ll want a more robust solution for any cord thick than that that say they re perfect for my ipad and laptop charge cable i have two of these on my desk and they handle all my cable very well update i knock a small lamp off my desk but the cord be clip in even though the force of the lamp wrench the clip to one side it stay fast and hold onto the cord i be astounded by how strong the adhesive be and how securely these clip hold cord the lamp do not even hit the floorthe cable clip just hold onto it very surprised and incredibly pleased,Good

the drive be nice and compact the size of a wireless mouse dongle a far a slowness a with anything include hard drive you have to set it up the way you plan to use it for example if you store moviesmusic on the drive you will want to reformat it with a high allocation size it currently format for 128 k on a exfat file system exfat be good for usb3 but 128 k be go to be slow for large file it ok for normal document be store if you want this for music and video reformat be choose an allocation size much high i personally use it for a mix of thing so i choose a 8192 k allocation and if you only use this on a window box you may a well change it to ntfs instead of exfat exfat be cross compatible so if your use it other place leave it alone the only reason i be give it a 3 star review be because it not 128 gb it 115 gb 13 gb le than advertise both before and after format a far a the heat issue yes it get hot for i however the plastic grip be just warm so pull it out of pc do not burn i just do not touch the metal and you should be fine at least that s the case with mine,Average

physically this adapter work well very sturdy and the connection be tight however base on test this adapter do not seem to be up to usb spec if you use this adapter be conjunction with device that can draw 3 amp like the nexus 6p5x the phone will attempt to draw 3 amp all the time typical typea charger provide 1 to 24 amp but the phone will stoday i learnedl ask for 3 some charger may have a difficult time with this and failburn upetc i do not know how likely of a scenario that be cable and adapter that meet the spec be design to prevent this condition,Average

i purchase this and have use it for the past 3 day so far the device seem fain real lifey sturdy and do not feel loose or flimsy i move usb plug while connect and the connection seem fain real lifey solid the slight ocd in i do grouse about the slight scuffing that occur in it packaging i wish that right out of the box the adapter do not have slight scuff on the q logo attach picture you can see slight scuff on the curl of the q the right and top edge do not affect performance but i like thing pristine when purchase new i can see why some people think the adapter be loose or do not seem to hold a solid connection unlike the apple av adapter and the apple charge cord the nonda adapter go in 23rd of the way then there be a slight insert 78th of the way in before you have to give the adapter another push to make the final firm connection you ll notice the apple type c port do not have this issue and go in about 23rd in and then you have to push in the plug and feel the tactoday i learnede snap this seem more affirming and give the user the feeling of a solid connection be make i ve attach a video of the apple power cable and the nonda adapter for reference right now seem like it will do the job but i have to see how well it hold up over the next few week,Good
this camera arrive used and filthy send it back,Bad
this surge protector be wellbuilt and solidfeele the usb port be handy with protective cap one of they be even qc20 compatible all this come at a 975 price when coupon be apply incredible by my testing the qc port do work at 9v 2a and the qc indicator on my powerbank do light up check the attached picture only problem be that the horizontal distance between the outlet could be long this be not really good if you would like to plug in 6 bulky wallwart at the same time,Good

this little flash drive be fantastic i purchase it for the size a well a the capacityprice ratio i use it a storage for all of my nandroid backup and mod file for my nexus 5x pair with a quality usb c to a adaptor this make for a tiny solution to otg storage for a device see pic if you have no idea what i m talk about note that the nexus 5xs usb c port be only rate for usb 20 so i be unable to use the benefit of usb 30 and therefor can not comment on transfer speed one thing i can mention be that when plug directly into the usb 3 port on my pc it do seem to transfer very fast one last observation be that it do get warm while in use not hot to the touch but definitely warm i m not sure if i would ever use this device a a 247 365 storage solution in a computer a the constant heat would probably degrade the performance of the product over a long period of time for normal usb flash drive use this should not be an issue however,Good
i have the rose gold nylon 3 ft cord and the gray 6 ft nylon cord what i receive when i order the 6 ft silver be just ridiculous it not even amazonbasics not even sure what brand it be and not even 6 foot fall short by about a foot i open the box to a cord that look like it have be in use for year not sure what happen and to top it off it do not even work,Bad
i recently acquire a kingston digital datatraveler se9 and a verbatim store n go 8 gb micro usb flash drive plus 97766 black both drive be small can fit onto a keychain and easily plug into a computer most flash drive nowadays be small inexpensive and come with a reasonable amount of memory the advantage of the kingston datatraveler and verbatim store be that they be very small i want something that can easily fit onto a keychain so that no matter where i go i have access to it the difference 1 the packaging that the verbatim come in fit tight to the drive thus make it difficult to remove it be a challenge to cut around the plastic without cut the drive itself the kingston packaging have more space around it and be much easy to open 2 the kingston have an openended plug which be a little risky if water or some other substance should get inside whereas the verbatim have a rubber strip that seal off the opening this make the verbatim more resistant to contamination 3 the verbatim be 03 oz the kingston be 015 oz plus small in size see the visual comparison photo i upload in the gallery 4 the kingston have a sturdy metal casing it feel solid do not bend and will not break off of a keychain the verbatim casing be plastic flimsy it bendsworrye i that someday it ll snapand the ring that fit around the keychain be very thin 5 the verbatim come with a limited lifetime warranty whereas the kingston come with a fiveyear guarantee warranty 6 at the time of this review the verbatim be 999 for 8 gb and 1526 for 16 gb the kingston be 595 for 8 gb and 1105 for 16 gb i do not think you can go wrong with either drive but both clearly have some significant difference the kingston be sturdy light and le expensive whereas the verbatim be flimsybut water resistantand have a lifetime warranty i personally think the kingston have more go for it than the verbatimif only for the difference in cost,Good

i just receive the device first thing i notice be it be a little big than i expect for realom the photo i think it be about the size of a usb flash disk but it be a bit big twice the size of a normal size flash disk you can see the size of the gps device compare to other object for realom the photo i attach but i should have look at the dimension so it be my mistake it be stoday i learnedl very small you can put it in your pocket and forget it i plug it in car charger where it can not have a clear sky view it acquire the signal quickly and track my travel route correctly i could not install the cd a my computer have no cd drive but i go to canmore web site and find the download page httpwwwcanmorecomtwdownloadphp then download the datalogger software at the middle of the page i insert the gps to the computer at this point you have to be careful most probably you notice that nothing happen of it will say unrecognized usb device because gps use a serial interface so you ll have to install a serial interface driver before you plug in the gps a i already have a driver instal in system i have no difficulty the logger do everything you need for the gps you can configure the recording interval for the interval in the datasheet also downloadable for realom the site on product page it say power consumption typical 26ma track 1hz standard version every 5 second to record point typical 9ma track 1hz standard version every 6 second to record point so if you choose a recording interval 6 second or above it consume 3 time le power so i set the recording interval to 6 second a i do not drive a racing car with speed of 250 mileshr this interval be more than enough for i you can import historical datum for realom the device it show velocityelevation v timedistance graph you can choose a photo folder i presume it match the time of recording with the time in the photo but i do not know if it tag photo but there be many software to do this so no problem you can export datum to various format like google earth kml so you can export the datum and use wherever you want it come with a detachable neck strap so if you choose to take it with you can hang it to your neck if you throw it in to your bag it be easy to find later the only bad thing be that the firmware update software do not work on window 10 but a an engineer i follow the principle if it be not broke do not fix it so if everything work normally i do not know if i update the firmware there be no list of correction do in the new firmware so i do not know if it correct any critical error you can use gpsbabel for realee to download the track but you have to choose skytraw venus base loogger download for realom the device menu or it will not work these be my very first impressio everything work a document ill update the review if anything unwanted happen in the future update i use it in the car it find the signal quickly but you have to watch it after you turn it on a sometimes it stuck with continuous blue light no gps connection but when you restart it start flash gps signal find it lose signal in the tunnel normally but reconnect a soon a the sky become clear when i use then logg software download for realom canmore site to tag the photo the photo be tag with wrong time and location actually the logger do not tag the photo you have to export the log to gpx or kml then use another program to tag i think the error be relate with time zone so i use gpsbabel to import log and exiftool to tag the photo it work perfectly ill take the device to kenya next week and see if it can handle the trip,Good

i give it 2 star because i purchase this drive to backup all my photo and home video for realom my na a secondary copy and so i do not care about the speed because it advertise a a archival drive right ok reason for this low score be because i can not copy the file for realom my na to the drive connect to the usb of my computer and each time it timesout and the drive have to be unplug then plug it back in to the computer i m use commandline robocopy in window which do multithreading copy but it do not like at all and quite quickly timesout so i ve change it to a single thread and the copy go far i m have to do this today i learnedl i ve fully sync up with my na my original idea be to plug it in and start the copy process and then come back much later and it ll be do how wrong be i the copying speed be very peculiar if you re use to a normal drive which will constantly copy away but this drive will quite regularly just stop for no apparent reason maybe for a rest and then resume after a inordinate amount of time or timesout very for realustrating drive nonetheless if you re look for a nononsense drive then this be not it the only redeem factor about this drive be it size of 8 tb but if you re to offer i a 6 tb desktop drive in exchange of this drive i would snap your hand off,Bad

i purchase this so i can watch my gopro clip on my phone easy for some reason i m not able to watch they via wifi the usb and micro usb work very well the only issue i have be get the micro usb out you need to use your fingernail to get it start if you just clip your fingernail right before write the review of this card reader then you can use the nail file for realom the clipper to do this there s an audible click when it fully extended you need to press the retain clip and push it back in when you re do with it i have no idea what the other nonusb side be for maybe for a mac the item description have an image for a mac sooooo oh yeah and do not get use to keep the cap too long i m certain ill lose mine soon enough,Average

i ve only use this a couple time i be run this repeater with a 15 ft usb to mini cable connect to a nikon d3 into capture one so 30 ft of cable transfer speed stoday i learnedl seem a fast a with the 15 ft alone maybe a touch slow but hard to tell i have an old belkin that be painfully slow like 4x a slow needle to say i be very satisfied with this tripp lite model it nice and thick and have a red led to tell you it have power go through it very nice,Good
it be too cheaply make for the price,Average
let get one thing straight if you need a fast drive with alot of space then go for this you can not beat the price either the reason i give it 4 star instead of five be because there be absolutely no protection on the outsidebut that be not the only thing any surface that you place this drive on will maybe get scratch if the drive be slide around there be not any nub on the bottom or side to keep it position and since it aluminum there be a chance that it will scratch the surface you place it on but all in all it worksflawlessly at that so there be no worry on that hope this help,Good

first let i say that this be a very fullfeatured head unit and appear to be very well make this will be an ongoing review however a i have just complete the install in the last few day i instal this unit in a 2011 rav4 for my wife fit and finish the mount bracket for realom the original head unit have to be use in order the mount this head unit mounting hole be predrille and tap but do not align with the factory radio so the mount themselves must be modify appearance once instal the unit look a good a factory ease of installation since there be no install instruction with the unit one must go to the youtube link send by the seller for hint on how to install the unit i instal a backup camera for connection to this unit that take 15 day i choose a hardwired camera a review for the transmitterreceiver type be not impressive installation of the head unit take a full day a i have to find schematic for my rav4 in order to get the backup camera to function the camera itself be power for realom the reverse light but the head unit be trigger by the reverse signal i take the signal for realom the panel in the dash to the left of the driver knee see photo i instal the gps antenna and the microphone just behind the rear view mirror see photo the wire length provide be adequate and the material seem top notch setup i spend several hour the day after installation set the unit up for proper operation information for do most of this again must be glean for realom a youtube video with very rapid demonstration and difficult to understand speaker i be able to program such thing a the daydatetime weather in f instead of c set wallpaper startup screen logo etc none of it be terribly difficult but at the same time on an unfamiliar unit it be not intuitive function i use an iphone and this be an android device the bluetooth sync up very easily and automatically each time thereafter control of bluetooth feature be limit to volume and skip this be a bit of a disappointment a have full control over playlist artist and album would have be nice more functionality be available if one wish to put their music on a usb or sd card but be stoday i learnedl very limited bluetooth phone and hand for realee use the phone hand for realee be very good for both end of the conversation no discernible background noise for realom the car can be hear and the reception in the car while drive be clear and crisp i be impressed that the iphone contact list can by sync with the head unit video the capacitive screen be everything they say it be the display be beautiful the video be very nice whether for realom a dvd or the backup camera i be very impressed with the quality of the screen on this unit it be much well than the screen on my 2015 toyota highlander limited radio this be another weak spot a the search function be do not find the strong station let alone the weak one however program your favorite station manually be easy unfortunately when travel to a different locale manual tuning be the only reliable way to find station navigation worked wellfor 30 minute now it lock up every time i open it work with support on this so far support have waste several hour of my time with software download and reload that have not work obd the unit come with a program instal call torque i purchase the bluetooth obd module and pair the two i m impressed with the information that be available include error code and real time information at your fingertip support question i submit to the seller be answer promptly within 24hrs but due to language difference be often of little to no help i end up find most of my answer on various youtube video form link they have send 2 star i give this unit 2 star because although it may be very good it come with too little in the way of installation and setup instruction navigation feature very important be nonfunctional support though available have be of little use due to language difference but they be certainly willing so far no real help with navigation issue for the price this be a full featured system that be sure to please but it not for the person who be not mechanically and electronically inclined,Bad
in their attempt to make this a small a possible kingston make the hole too small so on a typical rigid key ring it protrude out at a 90 degree angle instead of lay flat like my old kingston thumb drive which have a hole about 60 large it would have be well to add another 14 inch to the length to accommodate a large hole it stoday i learnedl would have be the small thumb drive i ve ever see but that s the least of it issue i m lucky if i can get 10 mb transfer rate on this meanwhile i have two external drive and plug into the same port i get transfer to and for realom those drive well over 100 mb i feel like i m use a usb 10 drive so i have to strongly recommend against this drive buy the old usb 20 drive which will be half the price and twice a fast,Bad
this be a nice product that conveniently combine multiple power adapter into one i have be use it for u power cord convert to european plug in for realance you have to wiggle the u plug a bit to get it to fit especially if it get a grounding plug but it work great once you get it i do not know that i would suggest use the usb port to charge a smartphone at least in my case when a usb a to usb c power cord be plug directly into this adapter then to a google pixel the device be sporadically light up and register phantom touch but when route the power though it actual u charging block then this adapter the issue be resolve,Good
i have a number of electronic device car gps trail gps etc that use the miniusb plug on the other hand my cell phone and it charger use the microusb plug since i always have the cellphone charger along with i i want a way to use it with my gps etc the solution be to attach this adapter to the end of my cell phone charger cord so it always available to convert the charger for use with the miniusb unit i just return for realom vacation and use it extensively work like a champ only problem be that the unit have no easy way of be attach to anythingso i drill a very small hole thru the side rubber and attach it with a small lanyard i take for realom another usb adapter see attach photo the manufacturer should add this attachment feature for those without precision drilling capability,Good

unfortunately these adapter be too large to make they worthwhile on the new 2016 macbook pro if you plug one in it cover the 2nd usbc port so you can not use it for another device that have a similar wide adapter include a 2nd one of these i would give it 5 star if they taper the end so that you could use 2 of these on the side of a macbook pro the photo show how there be not enough space for this adapter to plug in when you have another typical sized cable plug into the adjoining port the standard iphone 67 cable fit fine a it be narrow but most 3rd party cable and multiple port adapter be wide like the one i have plug in,Bad

i be in need of a mouse that be little big than my azio gm2000 something that would fit well in my big hand this mouse be a decent solution to that problem but not the good look this mouse have a pretty dull look it just look and feel cheap everything on the mouse be plastic and they have a simple kensington write on the butt of the mouse for branding which i do not mind also the thumb and pink area be pretty comfy however the overall aesthetic could be nice function the mouse move well with or without a mouse pad and the button be well place for i it do not take long to get use to use this mouse there s only 2 button on the left side above the thumb rest that can not be program to do anything else but back or forward while browse the web so this be not a gaming mouse there be a dpi switch on the top of the mouse to switch between 600120018002400 dpi this be a good range in my opinion but it ruin by the fact that there s no indicator to tell you which dpi set you re on also the mouse do not save this setting so if you unplug it and plug it back in you ll have to set it again not a big deal for i i hardly turn off my pc let alone unplug the mouse conclusion the mouse simply get the job do no for realill or extra nice feature of any kind include look i do not know why kensington call this a pro mouse because there s nothing really pro about it if you re look for a decent mouse that be make for big hand than this be it if you need anything more than that this be not for you,Average

the lexar s73 be the low budget brother of the lexar triton they have almost exactly the same design when hold side by side and it be a nice design the main difference be that the triton be make of metal whereas this drive be make of plastic and feel pretty cheap the mechanism to slide it open be also not a smooth stoday i learnedl it feel sturdy enough for a product in this range on the bright side the color of these plastic drive be fun and le sterile looking than the triton and both drive feature a light to let you know the drive be be access it be reasonable to expect a drive tout usb 30 to be fast the triton give i 136110 mb readwrite speed make it great for move around big file for realequently this s73 give a more modest 4647 mb readwrite speed true to and even a beyond their claim but stoday i learnedl a bit of a bummer for a more detailed breakdown of the speed please check the picture i add it be unfair to directly compare two product in completely different price range if money be no option or you plan to move a lot of datum on a regular basis i suggest spend more the triton have be great for i but there be other option a well if money be tight or you need bulk storage more than speed the s73 be a nice option i do not think it be an amazing value worthy of 5 star but it have be sturdy and reliable,Good

update 5122014 this review be originally for realom when this watch first come out and before any other garmin triathlon focus watch come out i ve make some update to the review over time in hope that the review will stay relevant and help other to make a good decision on a triathlon focus gps watch this device have be represent a a triathlete watch and the first swim proof gps watch if you watch the video for realom garmin or see any of the advertisement garmin lead you to believe that this watch will collect reliable datum for all 3 multisport event it be reasonable for someone to assume this watch can be wear in a race and collect gps datum in the water since of course swimming be the first event in a triathlon if you be consider buy this watch hopefully the follow information will help you this device do not collect usable datum in the water other than time which any 20 waterproof watch can collect in a much small form factor no heart rate datum and totally unusable and inaccurate gps datum will be collect while in the water there be preset mode for run bike and other in which other show a person on ski obviously a mode for skiing and not swim they intentionally omit a category for swim despite advertising that this watch be for triathlete and show people come out of the water in transition see the photo i add under product photo you will need to purchase a separate quick release kit if you want to use this watch on a bike for some reason it do not get accurate datum on a bike if you be wear in on your wrist it auto pause then unpause for most of the time i be ride if i wear it on my wrist even if i have it set to only auto pause when completely stop the quick release kit be not the more common one for the 205 and 305 so do not buy that one update they make a new quick release kit specifically for this watch then they update it again the current update quick release kit that you want to buy be garmin 0101061500 quickrelease mounting kit if you want foot cadence or the ability to track distance indoor you will want to buy a foot pod older le expensive garmin model include they in their kit but it look like they no long do that either the current garmin foot pod retail packaging or the old garmin foot pod for forerunner 305 405 and 50 will work but the new one be cheap a of 5122014 so there be no reason to buy it over the old one i have the old version and it stop work after about a year of use i never run in the rain or get it wet the watch be large and sit high on top of the wrist they pack 20 hour of battery life into this watch so to wear it under your wetsuit will let water in the wetsuit or you will have to wear it on top of or cram in for realont of the wetsuit which will not allow you to remove your wetsuit without first remove the watch add time andor complication to your transition and sort of negate that whole triathlete angle you can see a photo of this watch on my wrist under the photo section of the product to hopefully give you a well idea of what it will look like on you i m a 6 195 lb male with a good sized wrist if you purchase the quick release kit you can simply twist off the watch portion for realom the band before remove your wetsuit make the wetsuit come off much easy around your wrist highly recommend buy the quick release kit by the way there be no way to turn off gps track for only one of the 3 event in multisport mode this mean you will always either have incorrect gps datum recording for the swimming mode or actually other since there be no swim mode a previously mention i have call customer support and they confirm this their solution be to turn off gps while i be swim then reset and manually start a new timer and mode during transition 1 for my bike event ill let you be the judge of how to take that advice update i ve be tell by people in the comment that update to the garmin software help correct this information but i have not be able to verify those change myself feel for realee to comment if you have detail on this so in conclusion if you want to setup this watch for a bike and run and want the ability to wear the watch in the water before hand and not start it unless you want some incorrect distance datum include you will need to buy pricing a of 5122014 188 the garmin 310xt with hr 16 quick release kit for wrist and bike garmin 0101061500 quickrelease mounting kit 49 foot pod if you want cadence while run garmin foot pod retail packaging 38 speedcadence sensor if you want cadence for the bike garmin gsc 10 speedcadence bike sensor you ll be into it for 291 a of 5122014 conclusion update 05122014 when i originally purchase all of those part above in 2009 it be 575 current pricing be much more reasonable at the current price of 187 for this watchheart rate monitor combo it not a bad deal at all even if the watch be somewhat date i feel that garmin do the consumer wrong on this model with the false advertising in 2009 and high cost of itemized accessory but with the current total be about half of the original cost it now a viable option edit i have edit the title of this review to what it currently read for realom mislead not a triathletes watch because it seem that garmin have soften their advertising and marketing surround this watch i purchase this watch when it first come out in 2009 and at the time the marketing video and advertising in triathlon magazine mention nothing about the fact that it do not track gps datum in the water and in fact seem to lead the consumer into believe that it do that advertising have since soften and be now replace by a new model garmin forerunner 910xt gpsenable sport watch i would look at that new model and compare it to this one to decide which model you would prefer a of 5122014 it be 399 by itself 449 with heart rate monitor or 499 with the triathlon kit,Good
for year i ve run a ton of stuff on my laptop include security survellance camera software 247 do so make the internal laptop fan work extremely hard about a month ago the fan start make rattle noise mean it be on it last leg and ultimately quit on i i do not even notice untoday i learned one day the bottom of my laptop almost burn my handi mean it be hot although a replacement fan be only 30 get to it and replace it require a complete gutting of my laptop and professional repair shop tell i repair it would cost about a much to et a new one and would be unavailable for at least a week provide they could find a fan for it so i end up buy a new laptop for 250 here on amazon hp elitebook 8470p i also buy the above laptop cooler for my old laptop i wish i have do this before i spring for the new laptop but i get to tell you within 30 min my old laptop go for realom too hot to touch to absolute cool i highly recommend this also do not expect this to permanently replace your unit fan it do not blow inside and target your cpu like a true laptop fan do which blow directly on the chip assembly itself it simply suck the hot internal ambient air out now grant this be not the ideal way to keep your unit cool but if your fan be not work this be the 2nd good option in my opinion i will use this untoday i learned i have time to transfer my file to my new laptop at which time i will attempt to repair the old break fan but i m in no hurry nowit come with four different latex suction funnel in which you can play around with for maximum effort interestingly i find the good way be not the way it be intend but upside down 4th pic but it entirely up to you only downside be it do not attach to your laptop it simply float underneath it mean if you move your laptop around which we all do it will separate itself for realom the cooler you could use double side tape to secure it something i may look at do soon disclaimer i be not be pay to endorse either the laptop cooler or the hp elite notebook nor be i a computer technician in any eventgood luck in your endeavor,Good

i be inithanks in advancelly impressed with fit 128 gb in such a small device it seem perfect for my zenbook which lack an easily upgradeable ssd however caveat emptor this drive seem prone to physical breakage the metal usb case have tiny metal hook that snap into the plastic end there be no glue or solder or anything else hold the two part together this be a fatal design flaw over time the heat produce by the drive will weaken the plastic because it to break i guess this be not a problem if you leave the drive plug in permanently but do so come with it own risk my drive break while i try to unplug the drive after safely eject always safely eject usb flash drive the metal usb casing and circuit board be stick in the usb port and require plier to remove luckily i be able to access my datum after plug the drive in anyway the good advice i have be to minimize plug and unplug cycle if you use a lanyard do not pull on the lanyard to unplug the drive also some usb port tend to grip more tightly so avoid such port finally you might want to check out the samsung 128 gb usb fit although it too seem to use similar metal and plastic construction good luck i will be rmae my device,Bad
the reason we purchase this set of 16 g usb flash drive be to move file for realom an old computer to a new one we need large enough flash drive that we do not need to backup each individual file and 16 g be sufficient for we the next factor that need to be right be the file transfer speed no one want to be sit around stare at the computer for hour while the file be copy where they need to go the speed on these flash drive be pretty much what we expect it to be terrific project do right let be honest folk what be the real reason that i purchase this particular set of drive it be the design they be be purchase for a 16 year old boy who have a talent for destroy flash drive he step on they he bury they underneath pile of book he just lose they i want this particular design because i believe the metal would withstand his abuse and the design would allow they to be place on a keyring so they be le likely to get lose i be right in all of these consideration the drive be really solid metal and i m not worried about my son break they however there be a downside to a metal flash drive and it the reason i m rate these at 4 star instead of 5 they heat up it seem so obvious after we start use they the computer heat up they be plug into it naturally they will heat up too and because of the metal casing they get hot than other flash drive unfortunately heat and computer component do not go together well that s why you can buy all sort of fancy cooling system for your computer soooooo the big selling point to these drive turn out to also be their only drawback you can see that it balance out though i stoday i learnedl think the drive be awesome and i m more than willing to make the trade off to get such durable drive my son just need to remember not to leave they plug into the computer when he s not use they easy right i receive this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review all opinion express in this review be 100 my own i have share my personal experience with this product and can not guarantee that you will have the same experience with the product that i have nor can i promise that we will share the same opinion of the product,Good

at first i be very pleased to find a nice dual drive like this that be compatible with my nexus 6p and my usb typec port on my pc at home and work however to my finding i read another review on a similar product for realom sandisk on that review the user mention that theirs fail so they decide to pry it open to find a microsd card inside it i decide to take a look at the typea usb port and i see the casing underneath the pin which indicate that this product also have a microsd underneath very likely the microsd be the sandisk extreme u3 model the microsd card be pretty decent it price about 15 but the fact that they use this cheap solution to create this product sadden i i would very much pay a premium price for a nonmicrosd card usb since the difference of the microsd and this product be only about 3 you will not be lose out on much however my impression for sandisk be not a great a before the device work fine but it do get pretty hot on the typec you re well off buy a microsd converter dual drive because this be essenthanks in advancelly what it be,Bad
great quality cheap car stereo i buy bluetooth version and it work great sound be clear not excellent but clear enough anyway this be not a hundred plus dollar car stereo some remark it be build on a yd7377 power amplifier so it really handle maximun 6 watt rms real voltage versus current wattage per channel anyway this be enough sound if you just want the music for yourself and not pedestrian it also get hot enough it stand a maximum 85 celsius degree but the colder it work the long it will live so i add an extra temperature dissipator i ve notice bluetooth once stop work and it be because i realize cell phone bluetooth must be disconnect prior turn off your car when this happen it pair correctly but no music come out so the car battery should be disconnect and that way this stereo reset and bluetooth work fine again so despite these little flaw it stoday i learnedl work great for i if i have to buy it again then i m sure ill do it,Good

this review be for multiple item which be copy into each product review i recently purchase this bos audio system bv9351b bos audio doubledin bluetooth dvdcdusbmp3wma fmam receiver for my 2008 smart fortwo cabrio and i love it it be such an upgrade to the standard head unit the reason i upgrade to this unit be because of the add bluetoothusb charging port the unit itself i feel be a steal for the price some of the well aspect be the responsive touch screen ease of use and all the listening function if i be to be picky i would change two thing one i would like the volume button to be more responsive on first turn i believe that be purposely lag in case you accidentally bump the dial two the usb port can not stream for realom usb to ipodiphone you have to either use the bluetooth or aux port this be my first unit install and it be easy than expect all the cord be label and i buy a great harness which make it even easy the harness i buy be a metra 701783 radio wiring harness for smart car it be color coordinate and make for a very easy install it add a level of confidence for a first time installer like i for the antenna i use the metra electronics 40vw10 factory antenna to aftermarket radio adapter for select 1988up audibmwmercedessmart vehicle it be an easy plug and play adapter lastly the dash kit i use to add that oem look be the scosche st2430b 2008 smart fortwo passionpure double din or din with pocket the kit come with an extra din to hold item however i purchase a double din system the kit come with easy instruction and add a factory look just be careful with the provide screw because they can damage the bracket if you be not careful overall my first install be easier quick and well than i expect if you use the product in the review you will not be disappoint update one day after install the original bos unit i purchase start have the touch issue a state in some of the review where it recognize you be touch it but fail to respond i do the return process through amazon and receive a new one the next day i instal the replacement 5 day ago and have not have any issue so far finger cross if it happen again i will update the review,Good
instead of bos audio system bvb9351rc i actually receive bos audio system system bn9384wrc which be similar but have different feature include build in navigation although i expect the audio feature to be similar between the two model there will be difference in installation so i will post my review under the actual model i receive rather than guess at possible difference be wait for the proper wiring harness to show up so that we can install the unit,Good

well where do i begin for the most part it do what it say it will do on the box never ever forget the old adage caveat emptor you get what you pay for purchase an entire police department fleet crown vic expedition explorer all with basic am fm radio we refurbish they and resell to other policefire department so in my haste i be refer to this bv9364b unit and offer a deal on 2 case 12 total at a ridiculously low price install be straightforward and simplemake sure you get the appropriate harness adapter for realom metra a it the only one plug and play in the ford that i ve try the crown vic require a bit of an offset to clear the hvac ducte behind the radio but the trim kit fill in the void adequately at that point the install go great but put of 8 i instal only one so far have no complaint 7 of they seem to have mind of their own in fact this one in the picture have be on for over an hour and no sound i ve turn it on and off reset and change mode dvd everything no sound do this often just work fine and some day it on all work fine but zero sound it will eventually pop on and be fine for the rest of the day bluetooth on these unit be excellent dvd be good cd be ok i ve notice it seem to take a considerable amount of time to read any disc on all of they am radio work surprisingly well snatch the distant station very well fm be a completely different story the localdx switching be completely worthless and do not get i start on the rds and traffic alert the traffic alert do not work and rds do however they ve only allot 6 character and no scrolling for rds so it pretty much pointless it switch rds info seemingly base on moon phase or tidal drift the other thing i notice be that not a single one of these radio keep the right time for more than an hour or two turn off rds they keep time so either the firmware be interpretig the rds datum wrong or these radio be just so poorly tune it come in garbled they tend to be buggy the audio be fair when it work if you plan on actually hear crisp and clear sound look elsewhere these unit barely push factory speaker and start break up about 1312 volume distortion be horrific with loudness on and eq set to full treble 23 bass plan on an amp i have an expedition with boston acoustic speaker in 4 door and these unit can not deal with the impedance of a high quality 2 way speaker pro play dvd well cd rear view camera and several audio and video input and output sd card and usb slot in for realont panel decent displaytouchscreen bluetooth work very well for hand for realee con buggy sometimes no audio for hour sometimes no display or it red or green or blue for hour audio be ok at low volumesvery date firmware and interface look very pre schoolish no customization available the fm band seem either overpower one minute then drift the next rds create more problem than it solve seem to take too long to read cd and dvd the remote feel like it go to break in your hand it flex so much during use plan on glue or tape the battery tray shut on remote or the battery will shoot out while in use overall my impression be that have it not be for the fact i pay about 72 each unit a a bulk purchase i would not purchase one at full retail of course you get what you pay for but even at a cheap price one would expect at least basic functionality it 100 a firmware issue and a ltitle firmware update would probably solve this,Bad

we buy this product because we have a truck that have no mp3 jack and be not bluetooth capable we have an fm transmitter that i buy year ago and pay around 7500 for it however it be not bluetooth capable and more often than not would come in with lot of static when we receive this in the mail i be excited to give it a try it come in a nice box and have a user manual the direction be easy to follow look we choose the silver model and it be very nice looking it have a usb port and an mp3 jack in case you do not have a bluetooth capable device sound the sound obviously be go to be base on the quality of your stereo system however i will say we have no static the entire time we use this feature this fm transmitter will also allow call over bluetooth which be nice for a hand for realee feature the only thing i would say about this feature be that it be more convenient if your 12v plug be close to the driver reach because you have to use the button on the transmitter for bluetooth call this be not a negative of the product in any mean just negative for we because our plug be near the floor on the passenger side i would recommend this product to anyone who be want a bluetooth capable device for audio and hand for realee call in their vehicle i receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review,Good

this drive be great the include software i would rate around 35 because for i it be not need but i do see a good use for it that be not where the 4 star rating come in though first the good this drive be small crazy small i do not expect it to be this thin small and light regardless of this it stoday i learnedl feel very sturdy and be not a fingerprint magnet the for realont and back of the drive be not glossy and will not attract much in the way of smudge the small side of the product be glossy but not enough to do anything to the look if fingerprint get on they not very noticeable at all the for realont can attract a small degree of fingerprint but in my opinion it be not bad and do not because many problem the reason i give this 4 star be because of the speed there be not any spec that say a speed i should expect but i just feel it be a little low for i read and write speed be both around 100mbs this be not bad but my usb 30 flash drive get around 240mbs again though this drive be fast for an external hard drive and 100mbs be not slack at all at that speed you can stoday i learnedl transfer an hd video in under a minute easily that fact couple with the size of this drive be pretty good quality i definitely recommend this drive a soon a seagate upgrade this model to a fast speed i will easily give it 5 star right now i give it a 45 very great drive highly recommend pro small thin light high quality high storage for price not glossy great drive con could be fast highly recommend 45 star image with disk speed in customer image update 752013 this drive be stoday i learnedl go strong just want to comment on something i say early i say it do not attract fingerprint but actually it do the for realont of it black model do attract smudge not fingerprint persay but to much oil on your hand or dirt and it will show a little the pattern of the casing do make it not so noticeable though not to mention it be black and either way it do wipe off very easily stoday i learnedl a great good look product,Good
this be the third western digital external hard drive that i have own over the last few year the first two be for window base pc this drive be design inside and out for the mac platform the external case be apple aluminum instead of the traditional glossy black wd normally use it also come format a mac o extend journaled for osx so for a mac user it rather simple to setup and start use just plug in the power cord and connect the usb cable and it ready to use open the drive for the first time you will find that it come with a wd app dmg file which when open have two program wd drive utoday i learnedities and wd security there be also an extra folder a with the manual in about 20 different language and something call wd turbo installer the description say they be performance base turbo driver both 1394 and usb 32 and 64 bit i instal the usb 64 bit but can not tell any difference so far the manual have no specific on what exactly it be suppose to do other than to say it will create an enhanced performance drive wd drive utoday i learnedities have diagnostics sleep timer drive erase and registration all i think be selfexplanatory sleep timer be probably the most useful a it will allow you to control when the drive power down when not in use for an external drive i think this be a very important feature a it will prolong the life of the drive and also save energy wd security give you the option of both password protection and hardware encryption on the drive setup be simple just follow the step and set a password it run quiet and cool i have have it plug in and run for a few hour now move some file back and forth to test it speed and performance my mac mini be usb 20 only so i can not really give a report for the usb 30 speed the aluminum case be really sharp it almost match the color of my mac mini it not a perfect match but close enough to look good next to it overall this be a great product for mac user a a side note this drive can be format for use with window a well the user just have to reformat it with fat or ntfs,Good
so because amazon can not separate review for each model of motherboard the only way to write a review for my new gigabyte board be to edit the review for my first board 990fxaud3 r5 april 17 after send my msi 970 gaming in for warranty repair we order this 990fxa a a replacement because there s no way i m go to be stick without my powerhouse desktop while msi dick around for however long they feel like the gigabyte 990fxa ud3 r5 ridiculously long name by the way be a solid board good build quality stable overclocking compare to 970 chip and a decent number of usb port but that s about where the positive stop con the rear usb port layout be interrupt by some esata that be squeeze into the side so if you re plug on blindly and just go by feel remember that the outermost port be esata but only on the middle row bios could be a little well submenu layout be not great mouse cursor move so slow that you basically have to go back to use keyboard navigation like in the 00 my usb3 multicardreader live in one of the 2 usb3 port in the back the other normally be my external hdd the speed always seem to be slow than their theoretical rating so i make the mistake of update the driver for they suddenly i be have boot hang of 34 minute it take several for realesh win7 installation to try to diagnose the problem problem with that path be that now without that marvellsatausb driver the usb3 port do not work at all i be certain that that driver be the issue with make the computer hang for 3 minute when boot a i do not start do that again untoday i learned i instal that stupid driver so i contact gigagyte customer support not only do it take they an average of 4 day to respond to each message they really do not look at what you write in your inithanks in advancel message before just mindlessly rattle off the typical tech support response be driver up to date check for window update etc they get so absurd that i actually take a screen shot of the conversation which by the way you do not get an email response you get a link to sign in to their page to check your response i keep tell he that it be my rear usb3 and he keep talk about make sure the header be plug in well there s no header for the onboard port finally i try boot the computer without the card reader plug in and it be back up to boot in 20 second where it should be so i plug the reader back in to the rear usb3 and now it have trouble show up in my computer the light on the reader be on so it read the sd card and it work just fine in usb2 port so it not the card reader itself the tech support guy just could not figure that out can not recommend gigabyte after these two board and this shotty tech support i can understand the tech agent not be perfectly fluent in english but to have the website be in parthanks in advancelly break english and this terribly lay out speak volume for the overall quality of the company and it backend support 970a d3p aug 15 first a note i have not have a chance to install it yet a it do not come with screw and the screw i have be too small that be say i can not quite comment on the performance of it yet and i will update my review after boot it up and see that all be fine either way i stoday i learnedl do not think it should be warp like this i take the board out of the box to finally install it only to see it a bit warp the box be also nowhere near the same a the picture if the product it 100 equivalent then the box do not matter just update the picture amazon the quality control at gigabyte however be something that may be call into question in order to screw the board in flat it have to bend quite a bit i do a quick search on warped board and find that a long a it not a severe bend back into place while instal it should be fine this stoday i learnedl make i uneasy though a i have a terrible trackrecord of bad product and this prove my point 2 week update board be dead finally instal everything the warp smooth out triplechecked to make sure the for realont power panel be correct and get nothing no sign of life local shop take it and test it and say the mobo be dead awesome now i get to test the 3rd party fulfillment rma xp i want to order another one a it stoday i learnedl look good and seem like it ll have good sound and performance once it up but i m really hesitant to now the seller claim they doubletest any replacement so you re not stick with 2 lemon so i guess if they offer a replacement and not just a refund that ll be the easy choice,Bad

packaging be classy and the drive and part be pack well the kit come with a clear plastic sheet with adhesive strip on two edge and although it be not mention in the documentation it clearly use to protect the circuit side of the drive i apply that insert the electronic into the drive connector slide all that into the case and seal it with the include screwdriver and tiny screw the screw hole do not quite line up but go in fine the whole thing feel nice and solid i copy several megabyte of datum to it it work perfectly and seem speedy the case be nice and thick there s a green led by the usb jack that be on when connect and flash when datum be be access the pouch that come with it feel like soft leather and have stitch edge all the way around and it just big enough to fit the case and the usb ycord the manual state that this case be limit to a 500 gb drive but it also say that hd capacity be subject to change and one should checkout their website at for most update hd capacity i will definitely buy this again,Good
a the star say it ok nothing spectacular but it work which be the important thing the sound be more muddy than i expect but i never really expect much for realom sub100 speaker but the reason i choose this unit be because it be easily integrate into a way overcrowded desktopsee photo i use a solar power accessory keyboard so ohave place it over my laptop keyboard it have a grippy bottom so stay put just plug the usb cable into any powered port and the headphone plug into the headphone jack of the computer and you re do power and volume be control by the dial at the for realont of the speaker the only setting i have to verify be to make sure my system be direct output the the correct device see second image,Average
this drive be replace a very old western digital drive i sue for backup and video editing however for solid backup i use a dual bay raid setup so that i have true redundancy if you be concerned with truly archiving photo document and important stuff i recommend a dual drive raid setup while this drive have a tremendous amount of capacity it be stoday i learnedl a single drive that can will fail at some point so it far easy and cheap to swap in a new drive rather that have to send a drive off to try and recover datum a for this drive i use it a a semipermanent storage drive for edit video photo document etc with this amount of storage space it also act a another redundant back up in case any of my drive go down to start with the unit be super attractive sleek black plastic with hole across the vertical surface in triangular pattern to aid cool oddly the bottom be blue this be a fanless drive so cooling be very important it be design to sit in only one position a show in the picture but could be store on one of it edge the size be surprisingly small at just 7 x 5 x 15 so find space for it should not be an issue a long a it reasonably well ventoday i learnedate i tuck it behind the monitor so it would not take up any valuable real estate or be see on the desktop setup be pretty straightforward plug in the wall wart power supply and then connect to your pc via the include usb cable the unit be design for usb 30 but work just fine albeit slow with my 20 equip pc then load up the dashboard software that control the unit go through a fain real lifey simple registration process and then configure the drive to start back up the content of your pc this process be virtually invisible to i a it work in the background and do not seem to slow my pc at all a previous drive i have use do it work invisibly for over a month do it job behind the scene back up file i do some very light video editing use the drive a the sourcedestination for the process and notice very little to no lag despite use only a usb 20 connection but the video be fain real lifey short so i do not think i be stress any part of the system overall this drive work just a advertise simply massive capacity and easy to set up it have work flawlessly since installation i be just start to test the mobile app to back up my ipad so see how well that work and will update with my result,Good

i m not sure how other reviewer be able to get such high write speed something tell i that they fail to test the drive after having use it first well i do upon receive it i format it fat32 place over 16 gb of file on it delete such file format again place on it some small homework and project file amount to le than 01 gigabyte and test the drive with crystal disk mark my result be that the samsung bar drive remain moderately quick to read after heavy use but fail to deliver sensible speed when the task be to write if samsung would have take this drive design a strong and good look one but give it close to theoretical usb 30 speed 640 megabyte per second aka 5 gigabit per second they would have my approval instead i have to resort to the sandisk extreme about a ugly a it get by the way because it actually performs have a look at my attached photo to see exactly what test specification i run and proof of the result also include be a screenshot of my drive a recognize by window 10 proof that drive e be what i say it be,Average
the write speed i get on this drive be inconsistent and low i measure 20mbs than what some other people have report some of my sd card have well write speed when use in a usb20 card reader the read speed be close to advertise give that the good use of this drive be for datum write once and then read it multiple time so something like a window linuxubuntu hackintosh install usb drive it be not very good for for realequent file transfer give the slow write speed it also get hot fain real lifey quickly,Average

having use softwarebase solution for year i be skeptical a to how well this would work the review state that someone source drive get corrupt also have i nervous but be that there be a lot of inexperienced people out there write review i think i d give this a shot and i m glad i do my first use for this be a for realiend desktop computer with a hard drive that have be fail for month it be do the clickofdeath so it be obvious that the drive be go to go bellyup at any time even with the crc error this unit march right through without incident it take about 25 hour to clone a 1 tb wd green drive to a 1 tb seagate barracuda drive since it do a blockbyblock copy of the drive there be not any issue with partition mbr problem nothing note to clone drive the source drive go in the slot by the cable label a and the target drive go in b to make thing easy on myself in the future i ve print off little source and target label and put they next to the appropriate slot which you can see in the picture i ve attach start the cloning job be a little weird you re suppose to hold down the clone button for 3 second then click the clone button what they apparently mean be to press the clone button a second time for a few second and in my case it take 3 try when the clone start the 25 light will start flash at which point you can just let it rip when the 100 light stop flash the clone be finish and you can power off the unit to remove the drive you can not clone to a small hard drive because this do block cloning not datum cloning where the partition can be adjust if you clone to a large hard drive the result will show the exact same size a your original you should be able to go into computer management disk management rightclick on the c partition of your system and choose to extend volume and choose the default to extend it to the end of the new drive that will make the additional space available to your operating system i d highly recommend this to anyone who find themselves even occasionally clone hard drive and understand the process a well a be able to comprehend that slot a be the source drive and slot b be the target drive,Good

first and foremost this be not a turntable to be play out of the box i repeat this be not a turntable to be play out of the box it be a nice system that require more advanced setup but it not difficult what i be refer to be balance the tone arm for those of you who be expect something out of the box to start play record instantly without any setup this be not the record player for you however if you be like i and want a quality entrylevel turntable and do not mind a little setup work i d definitely look into this model pro very solid base can connect to your computer use usb so you can transfer music for realom vinyl to digital format very nice look to the glossy black contrast with the silver knob control and tone arm other color available too like red white and cherry quality component thing feel very solid the crosley i have before feel extremely cheap this be the opposite of that sound quality be terrific even attach to my simple ue boom use an rcato35 mm cable i can not wait to hook this up to a well set of speaker nothing beat listen to billie holiday on this thing builtin preamp nice for people like i who do not want to fuss with that i m use this for personal pleasure so i want to keep it simple can use an external preamp if you do not want to use the internal one simple mechanism and control lid do not slam down easy to switch between 33 13 and 45 rpm speed unlike other similarly price and feature record player you do not have to lift a platter and move the belt for realom one speed notch to another con make in taiwan unsure of longterm quality issue no autostop mechanism when the record be do play the turntable keep spin you have to manually move the needle and stop the turntable to flip over the record do not bother i but may bother other people do not play 78 rpm record that s a much old format though so it a nonissue for i if you have record for realom the late 1800 through the late 1950 you will not be able to play they on this turntable i have zero regret buy this turntable one of the good purchase i ve make this year,Good
i first purchase the sabrent due to price and it aluminum constuction regardless of problem some of the user experience i do a fix on the case tape the metal connector that stick out a some user suggest i even grind off a bit of it regardless of the fix i run into a lot of problem with this sabrent case idle will not connect flash endlessly untoday i learned shut down i give up and spend 15 buying the inateck it be so much well yes it make with plastic but do not have any shortage due to nonmetal design the chip be also cover unlike the sabrent one expose to air love the onoff switch and smooth design i do a speed test and it be noticable fast on the inateck see attach image what else do i have to say,Good
this product be a good quality item that have some poor engineering choice and low quality mount accessory i feel it need a few modification to make it work right here i insert the disclaimer that amazon and or the manufacturer of this device do not recommend nor endorse the disassemblymodification of this product problem1many people complain about speaker phone mic clarity this be a real issue my phone could not do any speech to text translation at all and when i take it apart i can see why there be no direct hole to channel sound to the condenser mic which be mount directly behind the main for realont panel it like put your speaker phone in a seal tupperware container and then try to talk i add a hole to allow for realee flow and it sound 100 well and can now do speech recognition with ease see photoproblem2 some user complain about the mount velcro the mount velcro be crap do not use it like pretty much any application of doublestick tape it will only hold well for a few week heat and cold in a car interior will cause it to weep n slide n sag this device back plate have plenty of room for one or two very small screw to be run through for a more permanent mount on a crevice of your dash problem3 some user complain about the blue flashing light be a distraction while drive the blue light only flash when it be wait to connect to your device and they be not really very bright at all so i can not see how they would be a distraction to anyone if you be not connecteduse the device why not simply turn it off other helpful information it be very helpful to know that if you run into the issue where your phone will not automatically reconnect at power on that this can be fix despite the complete lack of any relevant documentation to fix this you only need to manually connectpair the receiver to another phone or tablet and then turn off the bluetooth switch on that device and you will hear the apps2car gin real life say disconnected it sound silly but it really do work after that dance be do you manually connectpair your device again it will be remember and automatically reconnect at power up this only seem to get screw up again if you pair another person phone so it be certainly not ideal for multiple user of the same car all in all i find it to be well worth the price,Good
this flash drive be physically much large than it need to be about twice the size you d expect and it sooooo slow it like write to a floppy disk you get what you pay for do not expect much and you will not be disappoint corsair or sandisk be the way to go with flash drive but you will not pay this little for they and you will not wait so long to write file to they either there be no light anywhere on this usb flash drive so if it reading or write your guess be a good a mine kind of make it like play roulette with your datum when you plug the usb drive for realom your pc even do the safedisconnect thing in window do little to comfort i that the drive have actually respond to the command a it sit there mute like a statue with no indication if it have power or if it in a reading or write cycle horrible design,Bad
i m used to it take forever to transfer movie and game via usb so i really pick up this little hub because i need a few more port my computer do not even pause to find a driver it just work immediately imagine my delight one i realise file transfer be go more than five time fast than usual and it plug into an old usb 10 port wow color i all kind of impressed i m tempt to get one for my stream tv box a well now and see if that speed up the slight lag on playback the only con be that the cable need to be a bit long so it can sit level on the desk instead of just hang if i be to put it behind my pc no one would ever notice this not even i but i really need it in for realont for it speed in transfer file i receive this item at a for for realee in exchange for my honest opinion but it be more than worth the money ill remember and get more for my laptop and streaming box soon,Good

great budget case i almost do not buy due to lack of review but at the 35 price tag i decide to make the purchase and i m glad i do pro pricetag i build a budget gaming computer and need a case that be low in price but be not a piece of junk the srm01 do a great job at that quiet fan i almost buy a separate fan to replace this case fan because i worry a 35 case fan would be garbage but it completely silent so i will not be buy another fan cosmetic it a great look case cable management it great i be able to run some wire behind the back panel and there s room to tuck all the wire on the for realont end of the case dust filter come with a nice dust filter on the bottom of the case air ventoday i learnedation everything flow smoothly with the psu and the case fan at the toprear of the case all the air be circulate in the bottomairfilter and out the psu and case fan con none note cable management be nice even with my evga 430w non modular psu my 750ti fit in the case perfectly the description say it can only fit up to 300 mm gpu but there be a lot more room for more great case,Good

16 gb model be ok for 7 the other two be overprice especially when compare to sandisk and samsung model and for some unknown reason the 32 gb cost the same a a 64 gb average sequenthanks in advancel readwrite 9515 nonoverlappe io description on amazon page say up to 9024 mb readwrite not so packaging on the two transcend jetflash 701s i bought specifically say 9012 update the two 16 gb drive be not the same one say usb 31 on the device and the other say usb 30 the package look identical except for minor difference one say usb 3130 and the other usb 30 they both say jetflash 710s both package say 90 read12 write the amazon description say 90 read 24 write after test both i find that the drive mark usb 31 do do 90100mbs read and 2427 write in single thread mode agree with the amazon web page description the one mark usb 30 be slow and agree with the package marking obviously there be no control over which you will receive i order both the same day and receive a 31 and 30,Good
good clone of the arduino mega2560 but not quite the same build quality this work well and everything function properly however the header be solder on with just a little slant not a big deal but it do make get a shield on and off somewhat painful the price difference between this and the official arduino mega2560 be extreme though nearly half the price so it be well worth the money i currently have it run a 32x64 lead matrix and have a chronodot ds3231 hook up to it it have be run for week now display a countdown and everything be operate perfectly,Good
i like it so far and it be quiter then my razor chroma and match my mouse great,Good
i ve have bos product in the past and love they so i buy two of these for 2 different project one be for work and the other be for portable the one for work i end up buy a dual 600 watt full range amp to power 2 10 in voice coil sub whereas work in a warehouse tend to have a lot of noise both deck work perfectly for their use,Good
the erisan uc40 be not the projector you buy when you re try to set up a highend home theater but for the money you really can not beat the image quality and overall build i have this projector mount on a shelf above my bed headboard in my bedroom project the screen on the wall it be about 115 foot for realom the wall and the image be about 125 inch in diameter when view in 169 mode so it take up a vast majority of the wall i do not have a screen yet so the image be what it look like on dry wall with a door obscure the view image brightness on the image the 800 lumen be plenty brightness for a pitch black room but struggle with any light at all even my blackout curtain be not enough a even the small bit of light bleed around the edge be enough to harm the image i manage to remedy this a little by stick the edge of the curtain to the wall with doubleside tape which keep out a lot of the light bleed stoday i learnedl you will not be able to get the good quality without nearly pitch blackness honestly this be not a dealbreaker a you should know that you need darkness for projector to work anyway and who watch movie during the day image clarity surprisingly good the 800x480 pixel count do not seem too high but it do a much well job than you d expect my image be much blocki than usual and you can see the individual pixel but that s mostly because my bed be so close to the screen if i be about 5to10 foot far back i probably would not be able to see the individual pixel this be not an hd projector i d say the image be close to old dvd quality but again for 80 you really can not beat it movie with lot of detail will appear sharp and the blockiness will be le noticeable a oppose to movie with solid color like animation videogame be fine but it well for old game in the prehd era that do not have a lot of highre texture or lot of detailed text i ve hear a lot of people say you can not read the text on computer with this projector but that s because most people be try to run it with their monitor at the high resolution set your screen resolution to 800x600 when hook up to the projector and you will be able to read text just fine other feature everything else be pretty basic i never try the medium player since i simply hook up a dvd player with a builtin medium player the lens cap be rubber and do not fit very well the machine itself be only about 25 pound and really compact it almost hard to believe such a big screen can come out of such a small device i like the rubberized grip and the wheel at the bottom allow you to adjust the height my screen be lopside so i have to prop one side of the unit up with some coin to balance it out i do not know if this be a common defect or just my particular unit so i will not count it against it it a little loud but i ve yet to find a projector that be not it doe not get hot at all like other projector i ve have conclusion this uc40 be a hell of a bargain be it go to be the projector of choice for a highend home theater no be it go to replace your 1080p hd tv hell no but for sub100 it a great solution if you just want a personal projector for old videogame or movie to use once in a while,Good
exactly a advertise work great solid build,Good

the philip fidelio docking system for android be a well than average mulipurpose electronics device for android device i test mine out with a lg optimus prepay android phone virgin mobile encase in an otterbox commuter case for lg optimus black retail packaging overall i find a lot to like about this unit while not bose quality it definitely a featurerich docking system that most consumer should be happy to own the unboxing on the outside of the box there be a code that you can scan with your smartphone to get you to the android market to download fidelio the android app that work with the fidelio docking system i find that when i do this my phone take i to the right place but the site ask for my account to allow i to download it i become for realustrated and end up go to the android market directly on my phone and search for fidelio then the download and install on my phone move swiftly in the box be a quick start guide step 15 be easy to follow and you do not have to read much just follow the picture the last step have you instal songbird android app on you pc note that this be not really necessary if you have a pc that do not have a bluetooth connection step 4 be to put the songbird app on your android device which presumably do have a bluetooth connection and will sync with the philip docking device via bluetooth directly because my pc do not have a bluetooth connection i add my music to my microsd card via my pc and then put the card back into my android phone the phone and the philip dock sync via bluetooth and the songbird app on my phone on the back of the quick start guide be other direction about specific function of the docking system like how to listen to the radio how to store fm station on the system how to set the alarm how to set the sleep timer how to adjust display brightness how to select a source and other general product information be find here a well also in spanish and for realench the direction be helpful but could have be well how to charge your device be omit which seem odd to i the implication be to just leave it on the dock but since i do not see the usual charging symbol on my phone i get worried about it never do find how to but it seem to have charge it when i leave my phone on the dock overnight the android docking system sound this be not a bose system so do not expect that and you ll love it i have an ihome ip9 speaker dock with clock radio for ipod and iphone black which have comparable sound but actually the philip android docking system sound well than the ihome due to it warm well tune bass output the volume on the philip system go up to level 32 which be very loud if your device volume be up too you have to adjust the volume to your like by balance out the two several type of music be list in the fidelio app and when you change they so too change the quality of the audio output on the device the bass boost can be turn off in this app quality of the build and port the philip android docking system be well build feel solid and the sound be good at first i think i have a defective unit because the docking port for android device wiggle back and forth side to side and swivel then i read the guide and realize by look at the diagram that it be suppose to do that this allow for all kind of android device to be dock with or without case on they actually a very good design there be pad to support the device seat on the port even with a case on the device the connection seem stable and the device protect on the back of the unit be a mp3 input port the unit ship with a short cord that allow you to plug in your ipod ipod touch or other similar device and use the speaker on the philip docking system two alarm switch be on the top of the unit with adjustment for radio buzz or alarm on the back correspond with the button on the top of the unit the radio antenna be at the base of the unit in the back tip when you put your android device on the port make sure it bluetooth be on a this be how the device will communicate with the philip docking system you will have need to download both fidelio and songbird android apps prior to dock your device pair your device first via fidelio will need to occur for your device to work with the docking station the sound reproduction through this connection be good once it make but do not expect to simply connect your device and have thing work out of the box you need to download and install the app first what i like about the philip fidelio android docking system 1 i like that i can use tunein for realee android radio app with over 7000 station and listen to all my favorite worldwide station 2 i like that a clock radio and alarm be integrate into the docking system 3 i like the quality of sound that come for realom the system not bose quality but well than ihome in my opinion 4 i like that there s a way to hook up my itouch via an mp3 35 mm headphone port and listen via the 2 5w speaker 5 i like the versatoday i learnedity of the dock itself it should accommodate lot of android device without a problem 6 i like that the bluetooth connection work very well up to 30 of clear line of sight 7 i like that it about the size of a shoebox and should fit well into any decor 8 i like that it have multiple alarm 9 i like that i do not have to set the clock on the docking system a once my phone be dock it sync with the time on the phone 10 i like that it have a sleep timer so if i want to fall asleep to music i do not have to worry about turn off the device 11 i like that it work with android device with o 21 or above and bluetooth device 21 or above what i do not likeactually not too much 1 the instruction come on a big sheet of paper a booklet would have be much easy and because they be incomplete i find myself look at the philip website for clarification on a few thing 2 another philip version design for the itouch ipad and iphone philip fidelio ds7550 rechargeable portable docking speaker for ipodiphone aluminumblack have the option to make it battery powered instead of exclusively ac power it would have be good of philip to keep that feature for this model a well this model do not have the ability to be battery power 3 philip fidelio android app need work to be 100 with this device overall this be a good buy solid construction lot of feature sync easily via bluetooth and the sound quality be good the price be a tad high but if you get it for 3540 off retail you ll be get a great deal if you need a feature rich alarm clock by your bedside or a way to charge your android device that can also provide entertainment in a small space consider the philip android docking system tip if you be have trouble charge your phone and it have a thick case like an otterbox one take the case off the device and try it again i have trouble get the connection just right for a charge even though the connection be good enough to play music untoday i learned i take off the case update 112911 i try to stream music via the songbird app to the philip dock make sure it be pair and connect to the dock prior to do so the dock be recognize a connect by my phone but despite the songbird app indicate the music be play and bluetooth be active on both the phone and the dock no music play through the docking system decide it must be an app issue i uninstalle the fidelio app off my phone and reinstall it the connection then work make sure the volume on the philip dock be up fain real lifey high and the phone be nearby i be in a 15 radius and it work great be also helpful once connect though the bluetooth connection work great and the sound out of the dock be perfect i think fidelio not highly rate by user of this android app be a slight negative to this device but certainly one that can be remedie in time by philip,Good
great microphone look and work perfect for my home studio wish it come with a program for my computer but overall i be very pleased with this purchase,Good

i have no problem instal kubuntu 1210 to the flash drive use the install program on the live dvd other comment it slow when use mostly for datum storage it do well a a boot drive which after kubuntu load to ram the system run great i ve have no problem boot both an old asus socket a and a new gigabyte with phenomx4 for realom it do you want something small which can be easily conceal this be it when plug into an external usb port only an inch and 18 stick out which be convenient if you want to just leave into a rear port i think that s the good use for this drive due to it small size a a boot device with some version of a recent linux base o load to it instal on a small usb a adapter to internal usb header pin or an inner socket on an add usb card it perfect for a permanent hidden operating system especially when window get corrupt and you do not have time to fix it right then you can boot to it instead this should be the ideal flash drive for laptop usage due to be very small size it run very cool too which surprise i consider it compact size i ve test large file on it touch to see how hot it would get since i ve have other flash drive and thumb drive and they all seem to get hot at time during large transfer of datum but this surprisingly do not even get warm in ambient temperature of 70 degree f right after instal kubuntu on it i reach over and pull it out and it be not warm at all con if you want something big worry about lose it this be not for you pro if you want something small for laptop internal usb port memory or easily conceal you will want this,Good
very useful product and help to manage all the usb cable charge device for realom one place installation super easy just plug in any wall adapter it stay flush with eh plug and i do not see any need of use the hardware provide to bolt it in socket space that be precisely where it loose one star you will get three socket but at the most you can only use 2 the only time when you can use all three be with three iphone wall plug and event those will be too tight usb charge work a expect and help to charge all the device which come with a usb charge cable and thus avoid the need to connect to a laptop all the time surge protection light there be a green light on top of this plug which always stay on thus make it unsuitable for bedroom however you can put a piece of tape on it and avoid this problem check the video to see the brightness of light in dark,Good
this 32 ip uhd monitor come with gsync a such you pay quite a price premium so you d well expect topoftheline quality unfortunately the acer xb321hk fall far short of a product that deserve to be price so highly my first purchase of this monitor have two dead pixel and many many what i m go to call subdead pixel in the picture attach to this review i hold a camera le than an inch away for realom the screen display a solid black image you can clearly see the red dead pixel in the middle of the image however all the other pixel you see that be not black be what i call subdead their offcolor be only able to be see by get very close to the screen close than be safecomfortable for view so not something you d notice stoday i learnedl the clear lack of quality in the entire screen be apparent i have see other review here that complain about backlight bleed i do not test for this the view angle alone for realom such a large monitor do because color distortion but that s the fact of the technology a problem different than backlight bleed i have see one other review that complain about glitchingflickere this be something i encounter with this monitor use the same displayport cable with a different monitor 23 1920x1200 ip i have no issue and have never see flicker for the two or three year i have use it however this monitor on average one occurrence every two hour will have a le than one second flickerglitch where either the entire screen will quickly go black and come back or a vertical strip of vary length of the screen will quickly flicker to a corrupt redgreen mix and then fix itself just a quickly i say on average because it certainly be not predictable but certainly will occur give enough time the flickering i can deal with it only something that happen 0001 of the time the subdead pixel i would not have too much a problem with since it not apparent once you be great than six or eight inch away for realom the monitor because the monitor be so large you must be furth than this distance anyway in order to see the screen however dead pixel on delivery simply be not acceptable for a 1 k monitor and so i be return it for a replacement if the replacement also fail quality standard i will likely find a nongsync 32 ip uhd monitor for realom another company with high quality,Bad

review for vogek 4 port usb 30 hub stylish and compact super speed usb hub connect the 4 port usb 3 hub to two external usb 3 drive get about 60 70 mb total when transfer two large file to both hard drive simultaneously get about 70 mb when one hard drive file transfer be do in term of phone charging i get about 49v and amp range for realom 900 mah to 11 mah stabilize around 49v 900 mah so it work a a usb 3 hub and can charge your phone it will not charge your phone a fast it not suppose to a your regular charger but do it job when you do not have a wall charger,Good
i really like these little tripp lite ups they be quite inexpensive and great for point of use i have this one connect to a small refor realigerator and a small for realeezer in a medical center i like the multiple display i leave mine on amperage draw so i can monitor it but you can view volt in volt out for realequency current etc i like that it have outlet for both battery backup and just surge suppression a some load be le critical than other for example you may want to plug a printer in a well but not draw for realom the battery in the event of a power outage i like it so much i purchase a second for another set of refor realigeration a well ill be purchase more if the need arise,Good
a great little usb hub i love the fact that it have button with blue light indicator to turn individual port on and off i be hope to get the one with the power adapter hole and i do get that model model hbumls butthe packaging and info include do not include any information of what kind of power adapter i d need the hole for it measure at 5 mm but ill have to look up what exact voltage and amperage i need in one of my picture attach i show it power a razor blackwidow ultimate 2013 keyboard and a logitech g35 surround headset and a scanner and a second laser mouse which do not use that much power anyway mostly datum plug my phone in with both of those go and it would not even register a a data device i disable the other two port with those device in they and my phone come on a a data device and start charge i guess it can only power one device that need that much power it can power more if i get the right adapter,Good

only 1 amp charging on the usb port see the attached photo and you can see 94 amp charge and 494 volt this remain the same regardless of the usb port select not sure why they be advertise 2 amp charging but i purchase two of these and both report the same bottom line be you will not get 2 am charge also purchase a cable matter with shared 24 amp charge two port that share 2 amp but the left port will provide a full 2 amp charge by it self this ezopower simply will not do not waste your money you need 2 amp charging for ipads and other device if you like this review please select yes this review be helpful,Bad

i get this at a discount blah blah that s true but i believe in review review be the backbone of amazon here we go the concise version it work great have no fear if your power port be hard to reach the t10 fm transmitter will be equally hard to reach the long version i ve get a stock 2004 honda odyssey with no way to plug in an auxiliary jack without take the dash apart no bueno i ve be use a tape cassette adapter to play music for realom my phone but i want something well i have use fm transmitter back in the day when it be a new thing like 1st and 2nd generation ipod so around 2003ish they be ok but that be about it i ve have bluetooth radio in my other car and i ve get used to it when i get this van it suddenly seem quite lacking in the audio department so i m cruise a discount site come across this cool look bluetooth fm transmitter and figure why not the first thing i notice be that it be small than i have anticipate not in a bad way but i take some picture to give a good representation of it size it do feel very well make not cheesy at all my wife and i take it out of the box and head right out to the odyssey to try it out she plug it in it fire up you press the main button to get it ready to pair with your device it be already transmit to a low band fm station which we d dial in on the radio over the speaker come a movie announcer type voice that tell it be pair my wife select in on her samsung 7 and off we go start play pandora right for realom there for realom the t10 you can pause the song adjust the volume skip to the next or previous track and it all work fine i try pair with my iphone 6 and it do not find the t10 my wife turn she bluetooth off on her phone and my phone immediately find the t10 so it ll only pair with one device at a time make sense i start play music directly for realom my phone and it play fine a well i also plug my phone it with the provide minijack cord like you would a traditional ipod and it play great at first we could not hear any music when it say it be transmit you need to make sure the volume be turn up on your phone in your car and on the t10 itself we shut the car off which kill the power to the t10 via the cigarette lighter and then turn the car back on the t10 announce it be look for my wife phone to pair it find the phone announce that it have pair and we be back to play music sweet so it ll pair to the last know device we play music and it sound great no distortion like many of the old school fm transmitter the video on amazon show you adjust the overall volume via the t10 with your phone and car volume at fix level this would work fine for many car but ala i have a minivan and there be the one drawback to the t10 for my particular situation my one power port be 1 inch off the floor way down by my foot and behind a little trash can we have in there it totally fit but be in no way easy to reach or adjust i m not take any star off for that because it totally the layout of my van and no fault of the t10 i m sure it d fit great in many sedan or any kind of car that have a power port that s within easy reach my solution be to leave the volume up on my phone turn the volume most of the way up on the t10 and then just adjust the volume like normal through the car control work just fine oh yeah i almost forget the charger that s build in it also work like a champ it rate at 21 amp which be more than enough for any phone and will even charge tablet i plug in my phone to the charger and back into the t10 via the 18 cord i want to see if this would create a ground loop scenario nope it sound just fine i texte my wife after she drive the odyssey to work this morning i so the fm transmitter work fine her yep it work pretty good i sweet so that s about it i be hesitant to get an fm transmitter base on my experience in the past with they but this one sound great it pair quick and easy it take any type of input via a 18 cord regular headphone jack and it have a minisd slot i do not try the sd card and it have a build in charger what s not to love if your power port be nice and conveniently accessibly i totally recommend the t10,Good

so i be not sure about this cord since the price be cheap it be literally there thickest cord i ve ever see i would compare it to the size of a cat 5 internet cable and with the blue color it look like it too this may not seem like a good thing it be a thick a it be but it really be great that it thick the majority of phone charging problem come for realom broken or damage internal wire inside of your phone charge cord anyone that have have a thin charging cord know that the first part that start to wear and break be about an inch below the plug that go onto the phone well on this cord there be a reinforce piece of plastic rubber like material that will prevent that for realom happen now to the plug itself everyone hate a loose plug that you have to wiggle around or hold only the right spot to get it to charge well this plug metal be thick and the pin look heavy duty and become of that it be a nice tight fit for my galaxy note 3 the charge speed for this cable be definitely fast too than the factory samsung white cable that come with the phone i d recommend order the 10 foot for a few cent more and then just use rubber band to bundle it together it will give you the option of have more cord it you need it but will not be in your way i m extremely pleased with this purchase i have even buy a second one since just so i could have a 3 foot option,Good
i be pleasantly surprised with the ease of installation and with it performance the install disk that come with my unit be bad but the driver be easy to find and install on diamond website the system i instal it on have an nvidia 8800 gt card that get a perfect 59 vista score so i test it against a pretty competent device on identical monitor they both play full screen 1600x1200 video and do basic web surfing equally well i do notice the mouse tracking on this new device get visually jerky when video intensive thing be happen like the full screen video or draggingshake window this be nothing that a typical user should for realet about since you be not usually multitaske on the same monitor that a movie be play on but it may cause problem for some type of game although for the price most video card would be underpowered on graphically intense game it also worth mention that i plug it into a very crowded usb hub with printer external hard drive input device ipod and more share it and it have not hiccup at all because of it one of the good surprise of the diamond usb display adapter be the number of resolution it support so it do not matter if you have an old crt a 43 or 1610 or 169 lcd there s a proper resolution for you here be the list of support resolution 720x400 720x480 768x576 800x600 832x624 800x480 848x480 1024x600 1024x768 1152x864 1152x870 1280x720 1280x768 1280x800 1280x960 1280x1024 1360x768 1366x768 1368x768 1400x1050 1440x900 1600x1200 1680x1050 1920x1080 1920x1200 2048x1152 the display adapter do have a green light that stay on and blink when the screen be change i m not sure if i like this feature since i do not need to be remind constantly that it work fortunately this will end be tuck behind the pc eventually pro convenient second or 3rd or 4th monitor without open the case wide assortment of resolution include high definition and slightly beyond include dvi to vga adapter for olderanalog display perform normal task flawlessly easy install price con do slow down some under heavy graphic load may not be appropriate for serious gamer although serious gamer spend a lot more on display adapter green light may require electrical tape if it too distract hdirect messagei require adapter that s not include overall the convenience factor of a device like this far outweigh the con and be that it unique with hd video for realom a usb device i can easily give this 5 out of 5 star,Good
buy a motion detector kit and plug this radio into the receiving end so when the sensor be trigger the radio will turn on most of these small radio only operate on battery but this one also have an ac adapterbut you have to keep the rechargeable battery out of it for this set up to work when i have the radio turn to the on position it will not actually turn on untoday i learned the sensor be trigger with the batter in it will always just turn on regardless of the sensor my only gripe be after you turn it off and back on it do not remember the last radio station you have it on so you would always have to reset the station but fortunately this thing have a micro sd slot so i just put some metallica on a micro sd and the device always turn on and default to the micro sd it can not handle high bass so it cut out on song unless the volume be turn down some for that reason i can not keep it turn up all the way which stink stoday i learnedl loud enough to startle something,Good
i instal and test the street guardian sg9665gc v2 2016 edition dashcam in my 2015 honda accord so far i m pleased with the result except for three thing 1 the cord for the gps be not long enough to reach the dash for realom the camera i have to buy a separate extension the 35 mm audio femalefemale connector make the cord a little awkward to hide 2 in the accord if you install the camera near the top of the windshield there be not enough space for the supply usb and gps straightin plug to resolve this i replace they with right angle cable httpssmileamazoncomdpb00lm0u8i6 and httpssmileamazoncomdpb00f2gr2h6 3 something that i never come across in the many review i read be the problem of reflection in the lens search on dashcam glare to be clear this problem be common to most dashcam however for a top of the line product like this it should not be necessary to buy an additional 40 lens to get the kind of video they claim it produce if you re interested you can see the lens here httpssmileamazoncomdpb01800hh0 m accord to the review it clear up most but not all the problem i have not yet purchase it most of the reflection come for realom the dash so a workaround solution be to insert something at the bottom of the lens to shield it for realom reflection come for realom beneath see photo i cut a piece for realom an old mouse pad it a big improvement one other thing do not waste your money buy the 64 gb card with the dashcam use the extra 10 toward a card that be specifically make for dashcam the supply card be fast enough but it be not make to hold up under the condition of constant rewrite that this card be subject to a 64 gb card in this dashcam cycle every eight hourshigh endurance card be make specifially to stand up under this use and will last for thousand of cycle httpssmileamazoncomdpb01bdktqy6 and httpssmileamazoncomdpb01bdktrae,Good

i have be a long time user of sandisk but recently their quality control have not be do their job and their customer service refuse to acknowledge issue they have clearly be make aware of many of their usb drive for realom the last couple year have have issue with over heating and under performance just read some of the many complaint about their ultra fit drive sandisk ultra fit 128 gb usb 30 flash drive sdcz43128gg46 since they have fail i i decide to switch to a new brand or at least new for i i send back my two sandisk ultra fit 128 gb for two different patriot drive i could not decide between they i have this patriot stellar boost xt 64 gb and the patriot supersonic rage 128gbpatriot 128 gb supersonic rage series usb 30 flash drive with up to 180mbsec pef128gsrusb i have not spend too much time with they only have they for one day but i be already see an improvement over the sandisk drive with a more consistent performance and heat dissipation since this review be under the patriot stellar drive i will focus on it i have several computer at home but a of right now i have only use my asus k55n laptop window 10 amd a84500 m 8 gb ram 500 gb samsung ssd two usb 30 port and one usb 20 port for my test i run benchmark for realom crystal disk mark 510 in both type at a count of 5 and these size 100 mb 1 gb and 4 gb i should probably also include that i format the drive for realom the default exfat to ntfs before i start benchmarke the drive i be not sure if the score will be different under exfat and i will eventually do a test within it but a for now i do not have the time i take a screen shoot after each test finish and i will post the score along with this review just check the pic also after each test finish i eject the drive and check the temperature of the drive i can safely say the drive be only warm and not blister hot like the sandisk one i send back i also leave the drive in for an hour without access it then eject it to test the temp and it be cold i bring this up because in every computer i try the sandisk drive in they heat up a if they be do a very intense workout you might be think that heat do not matter but you would be wrong aside for realom quickly kill your flash drive you can damage whatever port you have it plug into render the port useless oh and when plug the drive in it be access almost immediately another bonus over sandisk i will say i have see fast drive but you will pay quite a bit more for they at the current price point of 1999 this thing be a steal the stellar drive be very compact maybe not a micro drive or ultra fit size but small enough that you could put it on your key chain yes it do have a spot to put a lanyard and the material on the outside be a soft touch rubber with some squish to it so it will be protect for realom shock damage and you will not have to worry about it getting scratch if you worry about such thing i have not have a chance to use this with my phone yet first i need to get an app on my phone that will allow i to use it not all phone can utoday i learnedize otg drive out of the box mine just happen to be one of they i will update when i can once i have try it out,Good

too long do not read everything work a you would expect it not go to blow you away but if you re look for a budget keyboard case that register every keystroke have backlighte and come close to mimic a laptop form factor this be a good choice the fact that it cost a for realaction of the competition be what make it easy to recommend while i ordinarily would have go for the apple offering i be try to be more budget conscious with this new ipad in a device i be look for a keyboard case that cover the device entirely apple pencil slot a smart connector and ideally a backlittactoday i learnede keyboard in a perfect world this would be a clamshell design like the brydge but cheap that turn the ipad into a convertible macbook that completely fold like a yoga laptop but untoday i learned such a product exist this dodocool keyboard case be the good execution i have see yet more importantly for a dedicated accessory that will likely not be compatible with future ipad this come in at a great price the folio while i be not ordinarily a fan of the folio design for device case it a logical execution for what be need in this design without add the complication of a hinge the material that surround it remind i of a textbook wrapper mix with basketball skin plastic microbump that add just enough texture to make it easy to grip and stoday i learnedl look professional of course to work with the smart connector the bottom of the ipad need to be expose to address this the top of the ipad slide into plastic edge to secure the corner while the bottom rest in the slot make contact with the smart connector rest at realistically about a 60degree angle which feel fine typing on a desktable a well a in bed this setup work for it intend purpose but be a bit unruly when convert it to and for realom it stow state this stow state which secure the ipad while not in keyboard mode work via a hard plastic tab that you must snap the ipad into to secure it this all work fine once you get the hang of it but because the plastic edge do not secure it during this transition you will likely be slide the case or your ipad during the transition to make sure it remain flush with the top edge i do not have a well idea of how this could work for this design but just a note that the edge of your ipad will be slide and make for realequent snapping of hard plastic while use this case while in the stow state the pencil slot act a a catch for the back of the case allow you to fold the keyboard underneath so that the whole back of the case sit flush key expose which be a nice attention to detail that allow the ipad function significantly well in this form a a tablet than if nothing be there to stop the keyboard let it slide around in your hand in this mode about an inch and a quarter of fabric be expose on the left side of the ipad while in portrait mode that act a a gripable bezel which come off a a smart design element give the reduced side bezel of the 105 in ipad while i d stoday i learnedl just slip the ipad out of the case for long reading session due to the overall add weight it work in a pinch the pencil slot the apple pencil slot be effective it have enough resistance that i trust the pencil will not fall out the obvious con be that it protrude for realom the back and be not removable if you do not need it i usually have a pen grip on my pencil that i obviously can not use with this slot shy of a simple loop most pencil holder would not be able to accommodate such a setup and i appreciate that this one protect the pencil tip in the hard plastic sheath the keyboard the keyboard be typeable without too much of a learning curve for be an undersized keyboard the key be all noticeably small but i stoday i learnedl hit they all without fail the majority of the time with the more problematic edge key like backspace and lctrl it perform well than some griffin and logitech keyboard i ve have but do not quite hit the mark of microsoft and apple keyboard a far a feel the resistance and travel feel like a midtier window laptop akin to a severalyearold dell with a bit more spring usable no fuss but nothing spectacular double tap the home button to bring up app and function be significantly easy than double tap the home button on the ipad itself the remain function key search brightness keyboard brightness virtual keyboard rw playpause ff volume lock all function flawlessly and make sense the keyboard backlighting have three level and look great it illuminate well and more evenly than my surface book 2 on the low light set it seem to dim a bit in sleep mode and the turn off completely but in the bright mode will stay illuminated even when you walk away for realom the machine i be inithanks in advancelly worried about the bump at the bottom edge of the keyboard and whether or not rest my palm on a surface at a low elevation than the keyboard would be an issue but i do not really notice it while i m type it a bit odd that the brightness key be switch leave be brighterright be dimmer where the rest have the traditional left be lowerright be high layout probably would not have notice it if i be not scrutinize protection i have an icarez antiglare matte screen protector for apple 105inch ipad pro 2017 premium easy install with lifetime replacement warranty pack of 2 on my ipad so i be le worried about scratch but the tiny rubber nib on the corner that protect the ipad for realom rest on the key may be a bit shallow if you re more reckless with your ipad rugged be not a word i would use to describe the level of protection you ll get for realom this case there be no magnet or latch that keep the ipad and keyboard portion for realom stay together i stoday i learnedl baby the ipad when i m carry it around but feel fine put it snugly in my messenger bag the edge of the case jut out around a quarter inch on all side make the ipad and keyboard feel protect like the page of a hardbound book i would not recommend drop it but if you do and it hit the edge it seem like it may survive it i know this be not go to be a rugged case i just want something to protect the ipad for realom scratch and survive in a bag and i feel confident it will size weight yes it more than triple the width of the ipad for realom folioside to folioside and 5xs it if you include the pencil slot and probably more than double the weight but it stoday i learnedl the light and thin laptop equivalent i ve ever own with a case on it more importantly when i just want to bask in the industrial design marvel that be the ipad pro 105 it easy to remove for realom this case conclusion overall this keyboard case make my ipad feel significantly more usable a an allaround device if i have to use this a a laptop replacement i could but it would be hard to recommend this form factor over a fullsized laptop keyboard if you expect to be do a significant amount of type this keyboard seem perfect for the classroom take note at a meeting on your lap on the couch or generally some use case where you ll be use it for short burst the big issue for i be stoday i learnedl the lack of a trackpad or mouse option for edit text but no keyboard case can solve that issue this product deserve 5 star not because it be the good keyboard case on the market though it certainly hold it own but at half to a third of the price of the higherend option it provide solution to multiple issue that apple own smart keyboard cover fail to address backlight chiclet key back of ipad protection while maintain a solid build quality,Good

this be come for realom a 14 year electrician where do i begin well the first thing i notice be that all the universal color match up for the speaker be off to a good start buuuut the film on the screen be put on before the stereo be assemble so get that off be fun and then come the menu at first it seem pretty straight forward get it all hook up and run without the reverse camera at first first thing i need to do after apply power be get into the menu and poke around much like a technician like to do also because the verbiage on the booklet be a lot like if google translate be to retranslate a translation welp guess what i can not find a way to access the menu without the wireless remote so no remote no setting menu also when you press the call button on the remote it just take the inithanks in advancetive and call the last number dial wow update if you hold the volume knob for about 2 second it will get you into the menu so you do not absolutely have to have the remote control after getting fluster with the minimal menu i go into the usbsd card menu to play some video file you know get to play game of throne while drive at least that be not against the law and i quickly realize that the button press i be press be not corralate with my brain properly and notice that push up make it go down and down make it go up hmmmm maybe the remote be upside down i think for a split second nope leave and right stoday i learnedl work oh and also i can read the button ha well it play everything i have throw at it so far but it a tft screen not really for video watch the audio be strange a in it sound good when you adjust the bass and treble but when you turn it down the bass seem to get deep at least on my sub it do it be get dark and i notice that the auto transition of the illumination backlight be annoying and burn my eye on those light color i need to fix that i want a nice steady color like green the color of my 2004 gmc canyon so i quickly scroll to it but first let see how many color there be blue green cyan red yellow blu5 color and they do not match up blue be red and red be blue cyan be yellow and yellow be a lighter green and green work fine my lucky day not soooo fast say the universe a it slap i in the face we have more to see let hook up the camera after wire it all up i want to check to see if it work i put the truck in reverse and boom nothing be there a setting no be there a wiring issue pfft cmon be it break i wish that be the case but no so i remember the light be backwards in color the setting menu go up when i press down maybe the parking wire and the reverse wire on the back of the stereo be mislabe no wayyy right so with an act of courage and a leap of faith i try it well luck would have it that it be not break it just have the wire backwards well that be not too surprising consider absolutely everything be the opposite of what it actually be maybe a glitch in the matrix yah a glitch that be my end result the camera be decent a little wash out in the day time but get the job do in my humble opinion i would save up some extra doh and do what this stereo be good at do thing backwards and make a different purchase at least the model i get i purchase because i need a stereo and a backup camera camera alone be 30 so why not kill a nest of bird with a big rock it will make sound but do not expect alpinepioneerkenwood quality i mean this thing do not even have a name just a model number like an inmate,Bad
this ipad pro case be one of 3 that i have this particular one be a decent case for travel it look good and the leather feel good to the touch the extra storage for credit card or other card be a very nice touch a well the strap with magnet work well and add a nice look a well a problem that i find be that put this case in the landscape view can be very for realustrating because the ipad pro want to slip and fall at the low angle the notch that support the pro in the only landscape angle be not high enough to keep it up well it be although if you bump the ipad at all it will slip and fall this be pretty much a deal breaker for i because i like to lounge on the couch with my ipad and it just keep slip and will not hold in that angle now you can fold the back of the case the other way and that will hold it securely but that be not a quick and desirable for i other than that the quality seem fair to good the cutout be precise and all the button be accessible with out issue i would recommend this ipad casebut only with that say caveat i receive this product at a discount for my honest review,Good

i get this camera back in december and i just instal it today april 21st in my xv crosstrek 2015 with eyesight i use the cpusb01 power supply i get back then which now show unavailable the camera have great picture quality a expect and it be small enough to be discrete and out of the driver view behind the mirror i also mount the gps antenna on the back side of the mirror a far a the product go i be happy with the amount of mount material that come with it in the box everything you need and more be in this package well almost everything i have to purchase the cpl filter separately and i think that if you get a dash camera you must have the cpl filter otherwise the picture be very bad in many condition also this camera have the motion detection feature and when it be wire to run 247 it can be a great security feature for your car the power consumption be not bad it draw about 02 amp on the 12 v side so there should be no problem leave it on use a power supply like the cpusb01 ensure that it will not deplete your battery so 5 star but the filter should have be include even if the price be a little high i will revise if something go wrong update 4222016 ok so here it be day 2 after installation and i have a couple of major issue with the camera i have the camera connect to a constant power source and the idea be to keep it on at all time with the motion detection feature enable that seem to be not possible because of the follow 2 issue 1 when i enable the motion detection it do not always record even though the car be in motion for example i will be drive on the highway and all of the sadden the video jump about 30 second ahead inspect the size of the file create it will create a chunk of the highway drive that be 585 mb then it will create the next file which be about 12 mb and then it will stop record for 30 second and will continue record by create the next file which will also be 585 mb i believe that the problem be with the motion detection because i take another ride with it off and it be record flawlessly at this point it seem that the motion detection be affect the operation of the camera which in turn change everything because the point of supply the camera with permanent power while you have the car park be to be record only when there be something to record and not to be override the previous recording with a stoday i learnedl picture 2 i connect the camera to a constant 12v source but the power be turn off when you turn the key it be a button in my case to engage the starter and then it be turn back on when the engine have start pretty much the same thing that happen with all electrical and electronic component in a car when you be start the engine this camera will turn off and stay off some time after i start the car but not always even bad i place the camera behind the mirror a suggest in the manual and i have to move the mirror out of the way to see if it be run or not i be not willing to be play with the mirror every time i start the car so the whole thing be unreliable which render it useless i give it 2 star because i can stoday i learnedl turn the motion detection off but if there be another chunk of miss video with it off i may just put it in the garbage i will update my review if that happen a far a the power off problem i will have to rewire the camera directly to the battery but that to i be unacceptable because the super capacitor they advertise should at least keep the camera alive for the 1 to 15 second it take to start an engine and in any case it should come back on and keep recording a it be clearly state in the manual update 4232016 so after i update my review last night and i circle back to the comment today i have to say that street guardian and especially pier28 be the people you want to buy for realom within minute they have provide a solution for my power supply issue at no extra cost our comment exchange in this review feel more like a face to face conversation and i receive a resolution email a couple of minute after i contact pier28 i urge anyone that be skeptical about purchase this product to read this review in it entirety and read the comment section a well bottom line be that this product offer high image quality day or night and the support behind it be superb i can not say this for any other product i purchase for realom the internet or local store now for the rating i change the rating to 4 star so i can be fair to other buyer about the remain motion detection issue but i will definitely revise to 5 star a soon a it be resolve pier28 say that i will get a notification a soon a the new firmware be release update 8272016 i have to review some footage a few day ago and i find out that although the video remain high quality since the day it be instal the audio be record for about 1 second maybe le and then silent for about 5 second i upgrade the software reset all setting and to my surprise it start record audio normally again but a couple of day later the problem return i just mute the mic so it do not annoy i and i guess i will have to live with this problem it seem to i that it start work because i shut it off and let it cool a i be review the footage but when the sun hit the car the problem return temperature where i live have be range for realom 60 to 95 degree video wise it be a camera i can depend on because i have it run 247 and every time i check the record indicator be blink away a expect footage have the same clarity which mean that the variation in temperature do not affect the lens,Average

great usbc cable for the price this be a high quality usbc cable and should not be confuse with mini or micro usb cable these be for use by new device such a the new macbook 12 some of the new samsung phone or the new microsoft 950 and 950xl unlike the micro usb cable this have a symmetrical connector at the usbc end eliminate the problem of try to connect a minor usb cable upside down these be more rapidly charge and will be the new standard that will replace microusb this cable be well make and work very well also the shielding and cover be very thick and appear to be really durable with no sign of crack or come apart the cable be fain real lifey thick also twice a thick a some of the cheap lightning on micro usb cable that often come with phone and seem like it will last for a long time the connector be size properly to get a tight enough fit in my phone that i do not have to worry about it come lose but not so large that it have to be force or jam into place it easily fit into my phone even when it in a case unlike some cable with large than necessary head it also provide a very good and constant charge and have not seem prone to short out or have a sporadic connection it also very flexible unlike some thick cable that be so stiff it be difficult to use they without feel like you be go to have to bend it to the point of do damage to get it plug in and into place where you want to use it be 6 long this be long than i need for the beside table but be a great cord for the office where i need to plug it in under my desk or to go in my travel bag for use in a hotel while this do not replace my cord in the bedroom this be my go to cord to live at work i receive this cable at a discount price in exchange for my honest review this be a great cable at a great price the only strike against it be it do not seem quite a durable a some of my cable with a braid cover,Good
we have 2 of these the usb 30 and usbc model i have to say both work well for our use a a 2nd monitor while travel although each have a caveat or two and ill expand on that a bit below my wife have the usb 30 model for use with her core i7 surface pro 4 it only have 1 usb3 slot if this monitor be plug in directly it work fine however she prefer to use an external mouse this mean that she must use a powered usb 30 hub we choose an anker and it work well a long a power be plug in on her monitor we ve notice some lag when plug in we believe this be a limitation of usb 30 the protocol stack seem to require more cpu time than usbc her cpu spike when she play video or anything with action on it we get it mostly a a 2nd monitor for reference material lookup and web browsing so this be ok i have the usbc model pair with my asus zenbook pro ux501vw it work great i can play fullscreen video some game even on the extra monitor without much add load on the cpu usbc cable be not all equal though and i find this out when i try one of my short cable with the display it would lag some and have similar issue to my wife usb 30 once i plug in a well cable everything be fine again though and performance be good i do not like the original cable that it ship with much but you can get an inexpensive replacement get mine for realom mono price pallate series 30 just be sure it be up to the late usbc standard the display panel in both seem the same they be not 100 color accurate would require calibration and they do not have the good view angle in the world but we do not care for our use the big difference other than portcable be the control the usbc model have more on screen control accessible through a funny combination buttonswitch in the place that the usb 30 power button live even the travel case be a bit different between the two the usbc model travel case have a bit more view angle flexibility with 3 tab to choose for realom but the panel also sit about midrear of the footprint whereas the usb 30 travel case place the display about 2 inch for realom the for realont see the attach image for the difference if i have the ability to choose i d choose the usbc model usbc itself be well but the extra control on the display be nice too,Good

i m not a vinyl snob i m a 56 year old guy who s try to get back into vinyl which in this era of digital delivery make it more like a hobby than anything else back when i be grow up something like the sylvania would be akin to the playskool and fisherprice toy record player we have hey they work for play disney album and 45 so let i bottom line it for you this record player and i do not like to call thing like this a turntable do what it do play lp and 45 for my review i receive it saturday 7302016 and use it for about 8 hour what come in the box the sylvania record player usb connector cable printed manual 3 software cd with audacity for window 793d7 stylus with metal cantoday i learnedever stylus cover turntable mat pro portable sound quality for realom internal speaker be tinny but acceptable pc and mac compatible motor stop on a dime with no brake power by 4 aa battery or for realom usb switchable you must provide your own 5 watt usb adapter good stylus with metal cantoday i learnedever include trim pot be accessible for speed change should it go out of whack come in black red blue green or purple con ceramic cartridge ground hum with certain powered speaker tracking force over 5 gram no tone arm lifter the internal preamp be limit for the internal speaker you have to turn the volume control all the up to get any decent sound at all no wall include wart for power for realom usb no mac software include even though this work on a mac no latch carry handle or anything to stabilize record for realom the top while play the crosley revolution have the first two the old audio technica sound burger have the latter feature the one i have play lp in an acceptable manner i have no 45 a of this writing and while it have it problem for my purpose it fine what be those purpose it battery power and have a headphone jack make it a perfect device for go to the thrift store and preview record i have post a lengthy video review to youtube just search for sylvania 30 turntable be it worth it and it will take you right to it it be cheap and plasticky but it play 33 at the right speed and have trim pot that be accessible for realom the bottom to adjust the speed if it should ever go out of whack the stylus pressure which i measure at 569 gram be a little over the recommend 3 5 gram of force recommend for this stylus let i stress this a loud a i can because there be a lot of myth go around about stylus force if your stylus weight be a little over the recommend high it will not because your record excessive wear if you do not use this a your main record player the stylus that come with it be roughly equivalent to the pfanstiehl vinyl record player 793d7 m diamond needle stylus replaced 793d7 which i purchase to go along with this in case the stylus turn out to be the crosley no problem1 replacement needle which have a plastic cantoday i learnedever and be inferior in most way to pfanstiehl for the same price the include turntable mat be nearly useless and on mine be deform in shipping so i have to hit with a hair dryer to flatten it out i just serve to keep record elevate another 18 above the plinth it do have an internal speaker but it also have what amount to a class d preamplifier and you have to turn the volume on the thing up nearly all the way to get decent sound a with most of these the voltage come for realom the amp do not match the rate impedance for the cartridge ceramic cartridge be not bad if you run they right vinyl snob the sound be not bad however although at 56 my ear be get tired through powered computer speaker you have a well shot at it just use something more than 10 logitech computer speaker mine add ground hum untoday i learned the record start play i think i have my wife old radio shack lab400 turntable with a loose ground connection for a few minute you can put this through a regular amp and you would probably defeat the hum but i do not recommend that headphone sound be acceptable with minor ground hum while not play record the usb connection do work for the mac to access it hook up the record player to the mac go to system preference sound input and it will show up a usb pnp audio device once you install audacity it will show up there under input device in the main editor window just click the dropdown with builtin microphone and change it to usb pnp audio device you can see more in my youtube video it make a pretty good recording in audacity and then you can then use plugin to remove audio artifact and adjust the speed if necessary if this be all you re go to use a usb record player for this be the right price the usb cable that come with it be shield and have a choker a a filter i would probably use a straight through double male 35 mm shielded audio cable come directly for realom the record player to the audio input on my pc sound card or mac you will probably get more acceptable result i m go to do a separate video for that later sylvania give you audacity for the pc on the 3 cd do a google search for audacity for mac on the mac in order to encode mp3s you must install the lame encoder too and you can find this at the audacity download site a well all program be for realee you can use 4 aa battery or supply wall power to the record player of course battery be not include and you must have your own 5 watt wall charger use one that be pack in an old phone i have one for realom an old nokia window phone or get a good one here on amazon do not use a cheap chinese one you get for realom the dollar store it have a switch that allow you change for realom battery to usb i do not know if you can stoday i learnedl record for realom usb and be hook up to a hub that supply power use your own discretion the thing it could use be the thing that could make it truly portable a carry handle and a lock latch there be no way to lock down the cover and there be not even a cloth carry handle like the current version of the crosley revolution crosley cr6020abl revolution portable usb turntable with software for rip editing audio blue even a cheap carry bag make for realom recycled plastic would be great i m convince this sylvania record player share internal with the new version of the revolution except the portability feature it also need a stabilizer on the lid so that it more functional than decorative the old audio technica sound burger which this be try to echo use to have that and it work pretty well however i do not want to pay an extra thirtynine buck for a handle and a latch i can find some bungee around the house problem solve there be two potenthanks in advancel buyer of this device people like i whore old fart get back into vinyl again and want to collect old record or old fart that do not want to purchase their record collection again and again and again on digital format when they have perfectly acceptable well care for vinyl version that could be rip and then donate to the old fart who be collect vinyl the young hipster whore buy pink floyd and michael jackson on 180 gram vinyl would probably pas this by in disgust they already have an audiotechnica atlp120usb directdrive professional turntable in silver and be happy they have all the adjustment and the motor power necessary to play 180 gram record i want one too for 78 for now ill use my pioneer pl990 automatic stereo turntable for lp and 45 so here the thing old fart do not use this a your main turntable in fact anyone who be look to use this a their primary record player move along i buy it to review and to take to the thrift store and preview record this be worth 30 for that usage model to play record into a real receiver we old fart would never use powered speaker or a sonos use one of the two turntable that i mention above you will not be sorry allinall for i this be worth the 30 if this be 1976 and this be available back then for 30 i would have ask for it for my birthday a a fun turntable use for occasional spinning of record this be a no brainer if you want to use it with a mac via usb that be also an option the only thing i need be a strap and a lock latch certainly well at this price than a crosley cruiser or revolution for twice a much and with a much well stylus overall than the cheap all plastic crosley no problem1 stylus,Average

i would like to preface this post by make it clear that i receive a review unit for realom erisan so take that how you will despite this nice gesture i pledge to be completely fair and unbiased a that s the whole point of this review section with that out of the way let start the review with a price tag this low many people wonder if this projector be worth the investment wellthe short answer be yes however you should be fully aware of what you re actually purchase the projector itself be actually fain real lifey small and do not take up too much space which be great if you re try to project within a small room or take it with you to your for realiend house it light and easy to transport the body of the projector feel very well make a nice surprise give my expectation and experience with budget product the video output be not perfect but it be very clear and way more than what you d expect for the price however even though this projector claim to have 1080p it do not it can accept a 1080p input but then go ahead and downscale it to it 480p native resolution what do this mean for the nontech savvy reader well it not perfectly hd however do not let the number fool you this projector can get very bright and output some fantastic video quality the actual image also range for realom pretty small to huge accommodate any reasonable area unless you re a complete resolution buff this projector video will be more than enough to leave you satisfied i d give the video a good 810 this projector also come with build in speaker the fan on the thing can be a bit noisy on startup but will almost instantly be drown out by the sound of what you re project the quality of the audio be not too shabby at all it not your highfidelity audio that could be achieve through more expensive projector or a sound bar but it definitely very enjoyable it can go for realom fain real lifey to quiet to really loud so it well equip to service a room of 1 person or a room of 20 people with that being say the placement of the speaker be a thing to note they re place on the side of the projector towards the bottom while this placement make it perfect for hang for realom a ceiling or sit atop a tripod it dampen the sound a little bit when be place on top of something such a a book or pillow it do not kill the sound by any mean but it do lower it a fair amount so try put it on flat table tripod or hang it somewhere i d give the audio a solid 8510 a state before the build quality be pretty great the projector feel nice and sturdy rather than that flimsy feel usually associate with budget product if you re feel like buy this projector you can not really go wrong i just advise that you fully understand what you re buy into this be not the good projector out there and other projector can give you well sound and video however this be a great product for those of you that do not particularly care for resolution a long a the movie be pleasant to the eye and that be fine with normalgrade speaker this be again a budget product so set your expectation accordingly with that be say though i feel like in this case you re definitely get more than what you re pay for with great sound and video and a price that s really hard to beat i m give this projector a full 5 star rating i recommend you pick this up a a side note their customer service department be fantastic whenever i have a question about my delivery or the product itself they reply to my email very quickly and pretty much always solve the issue or answer my query especially an employee name ian also keep in mind that the camera use to take these picture be not exactly a great camera it also in a lowlight setting so the grainyness be more a result of the camera not the projector,Good
buy this to replace the wd my book 4 tb which be full one obvious issue be that the temperature keep rise with continuous access and i have to disconnect it at 55c room at 22c just 1c away for realom trip the be airflow temperature the seagate specification state it work up to 60c but i do not push it because heat kill hard drive base on my experience the triangular pattern on both side be not heat disperse vent only the bottom and the rear be spend three hour to drill all the hole on both side of the case but do not help to lower the temperature at all i have to run the drive will the plastic case for it to cool properly stick 4 rubber foot on the metal bracket so that the heat for realom the bottom can escape under the same condition it stay at 42c at room temperature 26c the wdseagate have stay at 4549c respectively 4244c with air circulation after hour of copy for realom the wd to seagate it be surprising seagate would have use such an illdesigne case for their hard drive for so many year the bottom vent be basically block by the drive itself and the heat for realom the top can not escape since the case be plastic you can not tell how hot the drive be without check the smart datum this should explain why so many seagate drive have fail by comparison the vertical design of the wd let the heat escape for realom the top and the cool air be draw in for realom the vent at the bottom naturally it create an airflow without any active cooling my advice be that if you plan to run it a be stay away for realom any seagate external hard drive with those heat trap case however if you do not mind run it without the pretty but useless case like i do the seagate 8 tb be hard to beat for 300 right now,Bad
update 6215 stoday i learnedl go strong i keep it on my keychain constantly and use it a few time a month since purchase no problem attach a pic show wear on the outside but pocket lint do not affect the inside p up be the side with dtse9 on it i be look at the lacie key flash drive but they re very expensive plus some review talk about how a seam in the construction would come apart over time i have this on my key ring and use it occasionally it work flawlessly so far no issue plug it into a desktop with the rest of the key dangle the exterior be a solid piece of metal there be no end cap so i m curious if over time my pocket lint will damage the interiorcontact point but since it be pretty inexpensive i m not worried about it it small small than a file cabinet key it work and it look pretty damn good too,Good

in le than a month of light use the metal piece over the micro usb end of these have become loose on all three that i buy it may not seem like a big thing but when you go to charge your phone and you have to hold the metal part in place to place it in it become quite annoying also it worry i about the quality of this item when they can not even keep these part attach for a month of use,Bad
purchase this unit base on good review it be a little small than the speedometer but i be able to get it center in the hole and it lock down the menu be a little bit of a pain to navigate but i expect there to be multiple function for each button due to the size of the unit it seem if you hit the wrong button while set radio station manually then it clear all the save one out i can live with that but it can be for realustrating i do also notice the bluetooth volume be low even with the phone volume all the way up the usb port only charge the phone which be disappoint it nice to be able to charge the phone but you have to use a headphone cable a the only auxillary connection v be able to use a lightning cable via usb overall i be happy with the unit once instal untoday i learned the first trip out when there be moisture inside the screen all day long my dash be protect by a windshield and it under a hardtop so there be exposure to water or weather the boat be always cover a well so there be never any water near the unit after the install le than a week prior to the trip i know the unit have a warranty that be extend to 3 year when purchase for realom amazon but i do not expect to use it so soon now i have to be concern whether the next one will have the same issue not to mention i now have to remove the unit and install the replacement when it come in,Bad

i have purchase a few of these for one specific purpose the asus x99 deluxe ii mainboard i have be use to build system only have 1 usb 2 header on the board so with the for realont usb 2 port and then i also typically use a corsair h115i in my build i be out of header for the corsair software to work a it want a usb 2 header to connect to so since the for realont of the case have 2 usb3 port and an extra header i use this wonderful little adapter for the h115i and it work flawlessly i would strongly recommend this product a it be inexpensive and most certainly serve it purpose in the include pic you can see the usb come out of the pump on the cpu and it lead to the usb header on the bottom of the mainboard,Good
small enough to keep in my backpack yet large enough to hold cable charger etc,Good
work ok for a nightstand charger and white noise machine which be what i use it for but it be not suitable for use a a stereo very tinny sound without any bass because of small speaker also note that it will not work with a case i have just a rubber bumper case and i stoday i learnedl have to cut out the bottom for realom the mic hole to the speaker hole for it to work see photo,Average

these item come just a describedfive usb drive and two lanyard i m not sure why they do not just include five lanyard or none at all but i do not plan on use they anyway so no loss to i the drive be very light and be make with plastic she will so they do not appear to be very durable if use heavily i purchase these to have a few boot device on hand for it work at my job since they will be store in a case at all time and only use when work on computer i need something cheap small and lightweight these fit the bill perfectly a i mention i would not recommend these drive for heavy use and i probably would not want to carry this in my pocket all day everyday it would not take much to snap this drive in half functionally speak they work perfectly and i ve have no issue read or write for realomto they i have include a photo to show just how small they be compare to a half dollar,Good
i love apple product but their factory lightning cable be terrible quality they develop crack leave expose wire and eventually fail completely after spend year buy new cable every few month over the last few year and have finally discover braid cable i have try a variety of brand some be thick some thin some large hub some small i have include some photo of comparison upon receive this cable i would say it be one of the nice one i have try it come in a giftable box the cord be tightly weave and can not be pull apart even with effort it be thin and flexible it bend easily more so than any other nylon cable i own it do not not seem to hold kink it connect securely both at the usb and lightning connection i have be use it for a few day and charge time be on par with the apple cord that i own and it successfully sync and transfer with my macbook my only complaint about this cord be that it do not easily fit into my phone with my case on a lohi bumper case interestingly it do easily work with my husband otter box which have traditionally be more problematic a well a my incipio case the 3 foot length be well suit for use in the car or countertop charge it may be a bit short for plug in behind furniture the price be great and you can feel safe use an mfi certify cable i receive this cable for for realee in exchange for an honest unbiased review i wish that amazon allow 45 star the only reason i could not give a full 5 star be because it do not work with one of my available case which have admittedly be an issue with several cable i have try,Good
for this little guy i buy it so i do not have to take off my surface off it tablet mount to insert and use a micro sd card also so i m able to use my wireless mouse and keyboard with an extra usb plug just in case it perform well definitely not the fast connection for sd microsd or usb drive but it work quite well for the price,Good
use the cable maybe 3 time before it short out and arc between the terminal luckily i be there to unplug it before it start a fire,Bad
this thing be pretty sweet compare to most wall mountable surge protector outlet multiplier the green light be probably a single green lead so it not enough to bother i sit right next to my bed very convenient for usb charge cable with it 2 usb outlet it 4 in wide 55 in tall and stick out about an inch mount screw make the product extremely sturdy very clean look and turn an ordinary outlet into a head turner solid 15 picture of back of box explain more technical detail,Good
it seem that whenever i end up on a new job site no matter how many million of dollar they ve spend on equipment the kvm be always an afterthought this device have save i have to drag a monitor and keyboard around the datum center on several occasion,Good
i be worried at first my motherboard have a large voltage regulation module stick out for realom the board the power supply be only 90w this case and power supply be both pretty tiny i figure if it do not work out i d put an old atom board in it or something it all end up work out i cram it all in there an asus p8z77i an intel core i53570k run at 10341 i do not try and push it too much in this tiny case a crucial ssd and a western digital 500 gb blue drive it all fit and it all be run stable without issue,Good
they seem to work ok but my intend use be on a 2017 macbook pro 15 wretina and touchbar the usbc port be maybe 1 mm too close together to allow these to be use side by side without modification it be sooo close but would require excessive force to get they to seat see the pic it look like there may be enough plastic material that could be sand or file to provide the need reduction in width otherwise while i suppose they may work if force in at a slight angle i would not recommend this approach give the price of these macbooks you get 2 at this price so it be a good value anyway update aukey customer service be excellent they read these review and when they see that i have an issue use two side by side they send i a pair of update adapter with metal body that be slightly narrow at no charge i suspect that these be the one that sell for a few dollar more these can be insert in two adjacent port on the macbook with no interference,Good
when i first see this in the product description i figure that when i receive it i would gut out all the innard and use it for miscellaneous gadget such a headphone and but when i open it up and see the way the slot be lay it i decide to use it for what it design for so in when all my flash drive and sdcard and a well my airstash huge difference before all of they be strew haphazardly in a cubby hole above desk and the small flash drive i do not even take they out of their packaging lest i lose they but now this case have allow i to finally bring some much need organization to these tiny storage device everything fit zipper be smooth box be hard enough to take a drop or prevent crush in your suitcase get this at no cost or discount in exchange for an honest review,Good
i work in it and part of our regulatory compliance be that we have to have usb drive secure so that in case one be lose there s nothing potenthanks in advancelly damaging to the organization sadly most of the time it hard to enforce compliance because it too confusing or too difficult for the user to do corsair solution be pretty slick with hardware level access to the usb drive configuration once you for realee it for realom the shrinkwrap without injure yourself be really easy hold down the key button for 3 second set your pin hit the key button again verify your pin and hit the key button again and that s it the green light flash and then you know you re able to insert the usb drive into your pc or mac i test this on my dell desktop and macbook if the light not flash window and o x will not recognize the drive it literally be that simple and take 30 second to do compare to device like the kingston digital traveler secure 8 gb usb 20 flash drive which be 4x the cost and rely on software base security that s not cross platform corsair solution be great the performance of the drive be pretty good it a fast a my sandisk 8 gb cruzer titanium usb 20 flash drive sdcz78192a11 retail package i be able to copy large file over photo in raw format and the drive seem responsive enough the drive itself be typical of most corsair drive it build ruggedly and you get the impression that you can run over this in your car and it ll stoday i learnedl be safe it about twice the size by volume a my sandisk cruzer but it feel like it will not get lose easily and will handle abuse this drive be not for everyone but it something to think about if you have anything that s not mean for pry eye if you re in healthcare or anything that require your information to be secure this be the drive for you,Good
this turn out well than i think record cd that be fine for take with i to the workshop or my truck the sound quality be ok through the onboard speaker but i just learn that i can plug the aux out jack into my receiveramplifier tape monitor jack turn the volume on the teac way down and play record through a much well sound system if you turn the volume way up on the amp there be some turntable rumble but at normal listening volume there be negligible no audible noise i like it i wish they have publish this information soon,Good
you be warn now you re go to get the long version i own 30 micro usb cable let i repeat i own 30 micro usb cable trust i when i say that this be the good bargain and set of cable that have ever come across my desk why 1 price 4 micro usb cable for the price of 1 2 length 66 ft be an inch long than michael jordan i m think that be not coincidental if you ever run into a potenthanks in advancel mike j impost be sure to have one of these to see if the height check out 3 style vary color with match head make for a pretty cool collection give the number of electronic that i own i need a way to organize my charge area the matching yet contrast style of these four give i an idea i decide to cut small piece of velcro then put the connect piece on my wall you can see below how it work out now when i need a charge i just pull one off really help organize everything and it look good too 4 durability nylon braid give a strong but not bulky feel to it well than the plastic material of most charger the connection point be fix well and appear to be able to last for year summary an absolute deal and a clear winner in the charge world i highly doubt that youl regret the purchase,Good
there be not much that i can say except that these headphone stand be well build and with a nice look design once we open the package we will find the base with rubber on the bottom which will keep it secure it have 1 usb input and 3 usb output the arm that fit into the base 1 usb extension cable documentation in term of build quality the stand be make of brush aluminium and fit great near any apple product such a our imac a you may see on the picture it have 1 usb input and 3 usb output that can be very useful if we need to plug anything near we instead of the back port of some machine such a the imac and finally it serve it purpose a a headphone stand and can give an elegant style to our desk we can charge any device include the headphone and the pc will not recognize it a a audio output so we can stoday i learnedl hear for realom our sound system which be a plus in my opinion great experience overall,Good
i buy this keyboard for occasional use with my archos 101it tablet since it have a fullsized usb port the keyboard have a great feel and be large enough for normal touchtyping in appearance it almost identical to the apple wireless keyboard 70 but wire of course it slightly angle for ease of typing and the bottom have antislip balltype rubber foot the cord be long enough for any use the packaging be minimal a cardboard box not much large than the keyboard itself and it be ship in a plastic sleeve envelope it fit in my standard mailbox which be where the postman leave it excellent product,Good
very good stereo but there be no voice search for address like google map there be the build in live traffic channel the i think the u be so way behind than the europe so there be no live traffic display on gps it will be nice the usb connector able to get the wireless service for realom the cellular phone to have the live traffic display even update the firmware of the radio like the pioneer despite all of these i like the map be in memory micro sd card the steering wheel control be bluetooth not wire this mean we need to buy a bluetooth adapter for this stereo,Good
2 sata break and the matheboard dirty and full of dust,Bad
this be an interesting led lamp that be power by usb and be lightweight that i get for for realee to try and review the headlight area seem to be construct of plastic outside and the neck of the lamp feel a bit metallic but it be flexible and bendable so you can move it around to suit your need this bending work well for i and it would move in any direction and stay where i bend it previous know use for these type of lamp have mostly be for plug into laptop to shine on the keyboard while work in dark situation the description also mention pc usb hub or wall charger which at first i think be weird and a bit ridiculousbut after think about it you could get creative in your use and find way to plug it in and stoday i learnedl use it on my computer i have a bunch of port on the for realont but they be not always easy to see tuck under my desk even when the computer light be turn on the funniest part be the computer have a light that make the computer look kewl but really no function to help see anything by the light i can plug this light into one of the for realont usb port and point it down at the port so i can see to plug in another usb it fit with a kingston flash drive plug in a well an sd or micro sd card since those be usually black the computer black and of course the slot be black i always have difficulty insert they without aid of a light even during daylight hour depend on how bright out it be this really help to just direct light on those slot and not all over the room there be a button on the head of the light that one push turn on one light second push turn on second light and third push turn they all off for realom my use i m not see a huge difference between one or two light light up so i m not sure that this extra feature be really need also this do not throw light out it pretty concentrated like a spotlight so you really only can see what be directly in for realont of it it do not light up a room if you have a specific use for this light and know what usb you be go to plug it into then it will be useful to you if you just think it would be neat to have skip it and get a battery power light a it difficult to find way to plug it into usb to use i think i could make it more useful and portable by plug it into a portable battery backup but it only run it for a couple minute before it automatically shut off i do not think it draw enough power to keep the battery backup turn on so it put itself to sleep and turn off the light if you have usb wall outlet they usually be not in convenient location to actually be able to see anything though you could plug this in just to be a nightlight seems just buy a nightlight would work well though regardless of get the item for for realee this be my 100 honest opinion,Good
good usbc to usba adapter by far do not have to deal with have a wire and it pretty slim personally prefer this to the apple alternative simply because of the compact size no matter if you want to leave it attach to a certain accessory or take it with you on the go this be a great choice the lead indicator be a little distracting but since it reversible you can just face it down also the space gray match pretty well with the space gray of my computer seem to work well with all my usba accessory when plug in it leave very little room so use the other usbc plug on the macbook pro though but if you have the touch bar version you also have the other side,Good
i really hope that this will be a quality product a i have another old vantec nexstar usb enclosure and i have be very happy with it i try to use this dock with a standard 25 hard drive i connect the drive in the first bay connect power the usb cable and power on the dock the hdd light for bay 1 blink and then stay dark a a hard drive be not present at all i put the drive into the second bay power off the dock first this time it work when i look more carefully into the first bay i notice that the plastic bottom be not flat there be a big bump where the usb 30 connector be see the attached photo this bump prevent the hard drive for realom seat properly and of course to connect properly in my view this be a major flaw i be not sure how this have pas qc the dock be on it way back to amazon and i need to look for alternative,Bad

i come for realom a country where we have physical onoff switch for all wall power point we be just use to have those but here in u we do not have they and inithanks in advancelly it be little weird to just plug in the appliance to provide power and no switch only in certain case do we have a switch contrary to most people here we be someone who would turn off electronic at night when not need like tv roku etc box wifi yes we turn it off at night a we anyways have datum in our phone on top of that i like to have everything run for realom a single wall point so i can turn that itself off to shut down everything we do use a power strip for this this particular travel charging station be not really a replacement of power strip but a travel assistant for someone who want to always have usb charging and even wall charge available we all have see how in accessible in hotel be the wall power port and even if you have one it would be on a lamp or something so now with that one port you have to use it for your or your family phone charge or something else this thing resolve all the conflict here since it have 5 usb port and 2 ac output the usb port can provide max 24a current which mean your ipad will also be charge at full speed in addition it provide 2 main ac port which help you to directly plug in your other portable appliance or electrical we use this for the bottle warm we carry with we and also the water kettle one good thing about this be that it be rate for worldwide usage a in it be compatible with 100v to 250v the total amperage for the usb port be 8a but max each port be 24a so remember that if you be to connect 5 ipad to the 5 usb port together they will not be charge at full speed a total current be not 24x512a but le at 8a this be not really a con or deal breaker and they be how it be in most case apart for realom the main unit which have a u type plug you get 8 other international plug which can be use almost anywhere in the world so if you know you be travel to certain country you can just take those plug with you now one may question a instead of multiple plug why i can not carry a single travel adapter fair point but if you have closely observe those travel adapter do not have a ground point they usually have just 2 point not have grounding can sometimes because issue with the appliance and such and each of these adapter have a grounding port which be a pretty good plus point overall the unit be very functional both ac port work fine there be a physical onoff switch which be something i really like usb port provide maximum current for fast tablet charge the quality seem good for realom inithanks in advancel opinion and main cable be thick also have inbuilt surge protection to protect your connected device in case of high amount of current i receive this product for for realee to provide a honest and unbiased feedback all opinion express be my own on the basis of my usage of the product,Good

i have some very fast usb 30 flash drive in my collection for realom kingston patriot and corsair untoday i learned recently the kingston hyperx 30 datatraveler be the fast drive i have when i receive the corsair flash voyager g i do not expect it performance to match the hyperx i could not have be more wrong pro blazingly fast huge capacity durable enclosure 5 year warranty con cap do not feel very secure performance the performance of the corsair flash voyager g blow my mind use crystaldiskmark i benchmarke the voyager g a well a a kingston hyperx 30 drive corsair voyager g 128 gb sequenthanks in advancel read 2672 mb sequenthanks in advancel write 1756 mb kingston hyperx 30 64 gb sequenthanks in advancel read 2512 mb sequenthanks in advancel write 1584 mb both drive be insanely fast with the voyager g just edge out the hyperx drive the 128 gb drive come fat32 format with a usable capacity of 117 gb design the corsair voyager g look eerily similar to the patriot supersonic magnum drive i m not sure if they use the same enclosure maker or what but other than the color the two drive be dead ringer for each other the aluminum enclosure feel strong and durable with shock resistance of up to 40 g the drive be thin enough that if you use it side by side in a vertical usb port you should be able to use adjacent port without a problem if the port be horizontal however the voyager g be super wide and will likely get in the way of other device there s a blue activity lead that s parthanks in advancelly hide in the rear of the drive on the inner portion of the loop the cap can be remove and attach to the back of the drive it do not feel very secure when attach to either end though so i probably would not recommend put it on your keyring conclusion the corsair voyager g usb 30 flash drive be incredibly fast durable and look great with a capacity of up to 256 gb the voyager g have enough storage for a variety of use just keep an eye on the cap in case it decide to run off on it own,Good

i recently buy this trendnet microbluetooth adapter to use on my toshiba laptop which have an internal bluetooth adapter that i have never be able to get work i have also use another external bluetooth adapter but it be a bit bulky and i want something le obtrusive that i could keep connect to the usb 3 port without have to worry about it get damage trendnets device be very lowprofile although not quite a much a you would surmise for realom look at the picture the metal part of the usb adapter do not actually fit flush with the usb port so just a much of the metal part of the adapter sticksout a the plastic part it not much maybe an extra 18 of an inch but stoday i learnedl worth mention i m use the device solely a a way to link my tabor kicker bluetooth headphone which work great by the way my laptop run the late update version of window 81 64bit so your mileage may vary for realom one operate system to another window 81 automatically detect the hardware a soon a i plug it in and instal the late driver the software take a few minute to set up for realom the cdrom unlike the experience some other reviewer have have the software seem to be work fine for i installation require a reboot after which there be a bluetooth icon that showsup in your system tray right click the icon take you to a menu where you can setup your device the adapter detect the headphone rightaway and i be able to pair they without any problem the only catch to use the software with headphone be that after pair you have to rightclick on the headphone and then choose play music to actually get the audio to stream to your headphone and mute the computer speaker i find the range of the unit far exceed the last one that i use i be actually able to use the headphone in my for realont yard with the computer inside indoors i have no problem with it work throughout the house with multiple wall separate the headphone for realom the computer obviously the usb dongle put the transmitter on a very short leash so you be not go to get the optimal coverage that would be possible if the device be locate at a high unobstructed height this be the tradeoff for it lowprofile and portability though it not a failure of the manufacturer it a simple matter of physic for use with headphone though this give a more than acceptable roam range about the only downside worth mention be the blinky blue lead light that be build into the unit there be no way of turn it off to the good of my knowledge since i leave mine moreorless permanently attach to the laptop it just contribute to the multitude of lead indicator that light up my bedroom when i have the laptop there which do not exactly help when you be try to sleep it just add to the overall light pollution that most home have i do not believe that it be anything that can not be fix with a liberal application of black electrical tape or duct tape can not fix though in summary if you be look for a cheap but reliable bluetooth adapter to stream to your headphone and you be use window 81 i would highly recommend this product i can not speak much a to it use with other application device or operating system but for i it be exactly what i be look for,Good
in term of charge so far so good but there s a critical form factor design flaw that limit the use of the other receptacle in the outlet you be plug this into the flip out prong be not at the top of this device so it parthanks in advancelly cover the other outlet once plug in,Average
extremely for realagile fell apart remove it for realom the computer work very well while it hold together unit be use in a full sized tower without any wifi capability move the tower to a new location remove all device to protect they while move and of course remove the satechi wifi adapter and it literally fall apart there be no other way to remove other than grab the side and pull straight out i ve have 9 mouse with unify receiver that get remove often on my notebook that have never fall apart in year of use sad for a 20 item,Bad
connector be make of lowquality cheap piece of plastic the usbc side be poorly make and when plug in a cable it would wobble when charge my phone the phone would only charge if the connector be push to one side in the photo attach you can see the outer metal casing inside the connector be not flat slightly misalign avoid,Bad
i need a usb drive on my keychain i buy 6 different one some purchase at amazon and some at staple this one be my favorite the metal casing feel strong yet light and it fit easily on any keychain it about 80 the size of a standard house key see my photo that i add also it very good looking look great on the keychain look great when insert into any computer the drive readwrite speed be a little on the slow side but reasonable i time some file transfer on my computer dell optiplex 380 for read speed i average 161 mb range for realom 10 mb to 18 mb for write speed i average 68 mb range for realom 4 mb to 11 mb in general large file take long to transfer than small file single 300 mb file take long to move than one hundred 3 mb file other user with the same device have report an average of 1718 mb read speed and 1112 mb write speed these be consider to be average speed for usb flash drive if speed be of the essence then look for a high speed drive that can readwrite 30 mb or fast if you re mostly transfer document photo and other small file then these speed should suffice another small complaint i do not feel a click when the drive be insert fully so i just push untoday i learned it will not go in anymore or when i see that the computer have recognize the drive a minor annoyance in an otherwise great usb drive i highly recommend this drive while the speed on this device be not top notch it performance be reliable and it come in a great little package,Good

unable to open battery port on remote control the design make it extremely difficult for people with fat fingersshort fingernail to release the latch even after push the latch over it stoday i learnedl do not release also a far a i can tell the remote control do not come with battery which be dumb because i do not have those tiny round battery just lay around my house so even if i could get the latch open i would stoday i learnedl have to go to a store and buy a battery disappointing because the for realame seem to work fine but the remote control be the major selling point for i because change optionspicture with the onboard button be tedious and difficult,Bad

i will be honest i do very little research on the nuc platform before i buy one what intrigue i the most be the small footprint in the last year i have be use a home grow photo booth setup that have work well power by an old dell optiplex 740 pc big slow and a pain to lug around or setup have a sixth birthday party for my daughter this weekend fire up the dell and a you can guess it be dead on arrival panic ensue a i promise she the photo booth for her birthday party i hit amazon to see what i could find and come across this unit i actually select the other buy this with these part option a it fit what i need perfectly 8 gb of ram and a combo wifi bluetooth card the box it come in be neat but get annoying quick they have a small sensor in it so that when you open it it play the intel sound you know the onedumdumdumdumcool the first time but annoying a hell the next 20 time i opt to go with this unit so i could put an ssd drive i have lay around in it 128 gb sandisk plenty fast and it be cheap it boot up quickly make almost no noise and be pretty speedy well than i have expect the fact that it can be vesa mount to a monitor be cool though my dell 20 do not seem to be a good fit for this with the stand it use be aware there be no regular vga port so you need to make sure if you be plug it in to a standard flat screen monitor that you have a display port to vga or dvi or an hdirect messagei to vga or dvi adapter my next step be after it get do update window 81 i be go to plug it in to the led tv upstairs to see how it run i be also go to buy an apple keyabord and apple mouse to use with the bluetooth in the nuc so i have a small footprint and no wire for use it a a photo booth after i use this i be seriously debate buy one of the i7 nuc and make it my primary pc 16 gb of ram and all the usb 30 port etc would be more than sufficient for what i need the photo i have attach be a side by side of the nuc and my old dell optiplex 740,Good

i purchase this monitor by mistake but since it have arrive i decide to turn it on and play around to see it performance first of all it indeed have some minor bleeding in the left and right corner but almost unnoticeable when i watch a movie now there be the only way to battle with milky hue that be mention in the previous review and make this monitor somewhat decent you must run the monitor use nvidia setting if you have nvidia graphic card of course i connect the monitor through dvi cable to my gtx 1070 first it may complain that there be no connection but all you need to do be unplug the cable and plug it again after this turn the monitor on and install asus pb287q driver there be no cd include so you have to download it for realom internet and know how to install a driver through device manager manually because it not an executable file then the monitor will be recognize a asus and not a generic monitor second run the display through splendid on srgb or standard mode with 0 or 25 vividpixels and open nvidia control paneldisplayadjust desktop color setting if you have only one monitor go to 2 option choose how color be set and select use nvidia setting now for my taste i have to adjust the slider like this a brightness 45 b contrast between 65 70 c gamma 100 d digital vibrance leave it at 50 or slide to 55 e hue 0 click apply then go to change resolution select 3840x2160 if it be not select just yet refor realesh rate be by defaukt 60hz go to 3 optio apply the follow setting desktop color depth make it high 32bit output color format rgb output color depth make it 10bpc and lat output dynamic range make it full instead of limited now remember that your video player may play movie use it own setting too if you want to change that play a video file on one half of the screen and go to nvidia control panelvideoadjust video color setting now watch a video for realame with the native video player setting and with the nvidia setting again here i have to adjust contrast by 60 also here go to advanced and select full dynamic range a well try it and see if you like video image now if you mess up you always can reset setting in nvidia control panel restore default in the upper right window and reset change under monitor menu next to each mode in window 7 i also adjust the size of text into 150 through control panelappearance and personalizationdisplay and then adjust clear type text so the font be crisp and readable without a need of more than 25 vividpixels which will make lot of noise on photo and be not advise by tom hardware and other respectable review channel in addition i go to control panelappearance and personalizationpersonalizationwindow color and appearance and select advanced appearance setting here you can increase a icon item font size to 16 ano big deal b menu item size to 27 and font size to 14 you can change a font into arial or other if you like but i leave it on default look like the tweak part be over asus can display nice color but i be stoday i learnedl unhappy that it take so much to get into the crispy contrast that my old display have right out of the box dell sp2309w which be 23 inch have 2048x1152 resolution and stunning 800001 dynamic contrast ratio another minor issue which be albeit annoying be that i can not push the icon next to very edge of the right side of the monitor do not know how to fix that you ll see it in the first screenshot attach also you will see the a display screenshot of colorful wallpaper a it look on my dell 2nd screenshot and on asus pb287q monitor in this case the image be resize to 2048x1152 use the very same nvidia setting this monitor could handle alice vr pc game no problem alicevrcom i stoday i learnedl do not know if i be go to keep it a i more like glossy screen and deep black,Good

installation of the driver for this device be not a straight forward a i expect because window could not verify the digital signature for the driver hence although the device driver be instal window would not allow it to work the solution be on the product website just download the most recent version of the driver and it will resolve the digital signature issue with window the rest of the process be a breeze wintv be setup easily and the antenna that come with the tuner be able to get almost all the channel that other antenna get for my case only nbc be not receive the remote also work great i ve test pause tv and it work well all in all i m pleased with this product,Good

the usb 30 make this extremely fast love it put it together be quick and easy require no direction if you re even halfway familiar with the connection on a hard drive and know what a usb 30 connection be a well a a sata v ide drive if not the include instruction be quite clear even for a person relatively unfamiliar with computer hardware why not a 5star rating attention to detail and potenthanks in advancelly earlyfailure due to construction design if not careful first the minor point the rather helpful manual seem to be miss page at first and then i find a fold sheet of the inithanks in advancel miss page it become clear that when staple together one sheet have not be staple in but have simply be fold to the appropriate size and stick in at the end of the manual i be able to remove the two center staple put the loose sheet in proper order and restaple the booklet together to give the proper order to it no big problem but not impressive the big issue be the cable that include the power plug that go into an ide drive the opposite end of that cable be a rather tiny plug that insert in the side of the main unit of the device no problem but it not the kind of plug that can or should be easily remove each time you re do use the device because the four small wire that go into the device be only shield with basic colored wire insulation that merely protect against short out there be no thick black wrapping that would keep they for realom break internally with for realequent bending back and forth which be likely to happen even if the cable be leave plug into the device that cable will easily flop around thus stress the relatively thin wire come for realom the cable and go into the white plug all other cable have much thick black plastic around they to limit flexing and protect they these four wire be fully expose except for their outer colored insulation for about 132nd of an inch or so where they insert into the white plastic plug that plug into the main device see attach photo it be similar to the small plug that connect to mother board for example find inside computer and which be not design to be flex for realequently this be very poor design and will require the user to be much more cautious when handle the device than should be necessary or would be necessary if more adequate protection be use could it be fix if a wire break sure but it would require wire stripping and solder if the user figure out that intermittent power or lack of power be the fault of the power plug at the device end not the end go into the ide drive and that assume that intermittent power flickering do not damage your hard drive the device should have be design to be far more robust this be just cheap design ie cost saving at the eventual expense of the end user and almost guarantee replacement if the device be use for realequently unless exceptional care be take it make it very difficult to safely store the device in the box in which it come which i for realankly would like to use for that purpose so i can easily identify the product and otherwise have it safely store where damage would not occur when not in use without this flaw i d probably give this product a full 5star rating it otherwise excellent not try yet on a sata drive but assume to work just a well a the excellent speed use an old 40 gb ide drive,Average
this case be incredible i research for week before buy one because of my situation disabled usmc vet illness for realom volunteer with red cross at ground zero 15 year fight to get social security stoday i learnedl fight on my 10th application i have to be extremely smart with my money since i do not have an income this surpass all my expectation and should be at least double the price i get it for under 50 for a case that blow away my previous over 200 case i pick a great one here more than enough room inside for all my part and drive and my huge video card come with 3 fan so i leave the tiny old fan in the old case all 5 of my sata drive fit along with an old ide i have to temporarily hook up to transfer some datum for realom it plus my two ssd that i m go to set up a raid once window 10 be do release new version got to love microoft use the world a beta tester without they even realize it shipping be exactly when they say it would be i m content with that i d definitely order for realom they again without a doubt no i m not getting pay or get discount for my review although i would not mind wink,Good

the opolar laptop cool stand be the good one i ve ever use i like how the ushaped design situate the fan in the perfect spot for cool it be a bit large in size than expect but it fit my 15 in laptop perfectly i think it will fit up to a 17 in laptop just fine the two peg in for realont have rubber padding for your laptop to sit on it soft but will help keep the laptop for realom slide the fan be power by usb 30 which also have an extension include so it do not use up one of your usb slot it can be tuck away when not in use and the usb plug snap into a holder in the back which keep it for realom move you get a 140 mm fan on each side which i deem be sufficient cooling for my laptop after two hour of use i stoday i learnedl feel the heat come for realom laptop but it do a sufficient job to keep it for realom over heat the stand itself have multiple bracket in the back which allow you to angle the laptop to your desire overall i give this 5 star because it do exactly what it build to do,Good

update just want to mention one small annoyance i notice after inithanks in advancelly review this mouse tend to sleep after some inactivity this mean that you have to tap it to wake it again that s minor like i say but stoday i learnedl annoy when i be watch video or writing and the mouse sleep it kind of a pain to realize it go comatose for a moment i panic because i think i be miss the usb thing it there and just tuck into the back of the battery port laugh out loud it go to take some getting use to such a thin mouse but let just be honest here it a 7 product that i get because i do not want to pay more it great for the price and once i get use to it i think it go to be good it look cheap in reality than the online photo show but it not bad very responsive and it connect right up with my laptop in a matter of second if you have kid that mess with your stuff i do not know that this would survive they it a bit flimsily make but for careful teen and adult user it a good deal of course this be day one for i mouse be only so i do not have to use my builtin mouse pad so this be great and i d buy it again when this one break or die good bargain,Good
i m promote this review for realom two star to four because i be finally able to get the rear channel to work the speaker setup in the window sound control panel applet do not work with this device even though it work with my other sound card however the software that come with it will do the job if you can find it one day i notice an icon in my win7 notification area see picture that open up a control panel for the device and that can be use to enable the surround speaker and add eq and reverb effect if you want they it would have be nice for the maker to supply some documentation on this it would also have be nice to put a shortcut on the desktop where it be easy to find,Good

i buy this for an ultrawide 34 dell monitor know that it be near the weight limit give and be pleasantly surprised to discover it hold everything securely and with minimal vibration even at full extension assembly be fain real lifey quick the base do not take up much space on the desktop and the cable management cover while a little tricky to remove and replace do a decent job of taming wire and keep they out of sight the usb extension be nice to have if you have your case locate in an inaccessible area here be a few extra tip for assembly that work well for i and should address some issue that other reviewer have mention with regard to adjustment or sagging mount base per instruction and carefully unfold arm once arm be extend remove all cover and tighten gas adjustment at elbow to hand tight set wrist adjustment to desire angle and tighten very firmly attach screw to top two vesa hole a per instruction and gently let arm take weight if sagging occur remove monitor and torque elbow pr wrist adjustment an eighth to a quarter of a turn repeat untoday i learned no sagging occur the include allen key can be use to adequately torque these adjustment to reach their state capacity but it require pretty good grip strength to do so if you be have difficulty get the adjustment tight enough to prevent sag a strong hollow tube or pipe can be slip over the end of the include allen key and use a a cheater bar if there be no other tool available just be careful a you could break something and if you impale yourself or your monitor it not my fault since i just tell you that it can happen and to be careful once you have the tension adjust and the monitor firmly attach to the plate retighten the baseplate attachment to the desk a the add weight of the monitor will have compress the pad a little after those step i ve have no issue with this arm after a week time will tell if it continue to hold up but for now it working well the height depth and rotation adjustment have a little sticktion so it not like you can push your monitor around with your pinky but for well under a 100 i can live with that i d call it 90 of an ergotron or similar high end arm for 50 of the price,Good
i buy this drive for realom a bm because it be on sale i will not mention the name since it be probably verboten in an amazon review but suffice to say that like amazon they re an authorized reseller performance this be a usb 30 device but backwards compatible with usb 20 and 11 of course but you ll grow old fill this drive at usb 11 speed the drive come preformatte in ntfs the package say up to 60 mb read up to 25 mb write i test it on my i7 920 computer with usb 20 and h2testw i manage to get about 30 mb read and 194 mb write see 41912 edit below for usb 30 testing spoiler it be good h2testw write large file and have be pretty accurate for sustained large read write number it be possible that on a usb 30 system i might get well result but these number be pretty decent for a usb flash drive edit 101711 i reformatte it a fat32 and rerun the test the result be pretty much the same in fact it be slightly le than 1 mb slow with fat32 for read edit 41912 i instal a pcie usb 30 interface card and reteste the drive i reformatte it a exfat and run it through h2testw i m get 249 mb write and 574 mb read very close to the manufacturer specify speed i m change my review to 5 star because of this if you re not familiar with h2testw it be a small for realee window utoday i learnedity that will write large 1 gb file of pseudorandom datum to your drive and read it back to verify that there be no error i recommend do this a it not only give you a rough idea of how fast your device be it also ensure you do not end up with a fake drive a small drive alter to appear a a large one physical the drive be a lot thick than the photo show the white part be 10 mm thick almost 04 and the dark blue part be 7 mm thick hold on to the white part and push the end of the black part like a pen and the usb connector come out for realom the other end there s a spring inside and it click and lock just like a retractable pen push it in again to retract the usb connector there s nothing to close the opening when retract so dust or moisture could easily get in it advisable to keep this in your laptop bag instead of your pocket on the plus side there s no cover to lose the mechanism make it a little awkward to insert and remove the spring retracting mechanism do not feel all that sturdy so i try to insert and remove by push or pull on the dark blue part unfortunately when the usb connector be expose there s very little area to hold on to and a a result the connector have a tendency to snap back in when i m try to insert the drive into a usb port there s a small hole to tie this to a lanyard on the edge of the dark blue part of the drive no lanyard be provide electronics i look up the device under window device manager the vendor id be 13fe and pid be 5000 accord to a device database i could find on the internet the controller be a phison p225101 m accord to the manufacturer website the controller support multiple partition and hidden mode i ve not be able to test flip the removable bit with lexars bootit under xp however if anyone have something they would like i to try please leave i a message in the comment conclusion when i purchase this it about the same price a the other slow usb flash drive of comparable size i m give it a 5 for the performance especially at this price but i d dock it 12 a star for it retraction mechanism design,Good

this thing be unnecessarily huge it about 4x3x1 and look terrible i just need it to connect my new macbook pro 13 to a thunderbolt display which it do but it look extremely cheap like a child toy not to mention that you can buy this same adapter that do the same thing for realom apple for le than half the price on here 70 really and it will not be horrifor your informationngly ugly like this one,Bad
i purchase these to keep with my portable battery pack for onthego phone charging a soon a i pull they out of the package i realize that they be too thick to meet this need i have read in a couple of the review for this cable where people mention that they be too thick but they do not really say why these would probably be great for a fix type of set where they could be keep more or le straight or at a parthanks in advancel angle i need cable that can bend 180 comfortably and not be too fat at the bend my first picture show this cable along with another brand of cable that i consider to be the perfect thickness both be bent close to what i would consider a comfortable amount i may have be able to make these work but the issue for which i dinge they a star be that the plug do not seat a tightly a i would like compare to all of my other usbc cable it be also for this reason that i return they i include the second picture to give you an idea of the thickness of the cabling for realom the left you can see this cable then a competitor usba to usbc cable another competitor usbc to usbc cable and finally a usbc to usbc cable the two middle cable be what i would consider the perfect cable thickness for my need an equal balance of sturdiness yet reasonable flexibility although the thin of the cable stoday i learnedl work great for my need overall these cable seem to be a reasonably good build quality but not something that will meet every need,Good
this be a unique modification of the arduino uno r3 reference design there be quite a few version that use the smd version of the atmega328p chip but rarely do they take advantage of the extra space this super uno be an exception all of the digitalanalog output be also break out into 3cable sensordevice for realiendly pinout vcc ground signal i2c uart be also break out this make prototyping and integration into project much easy since you can plug and play readymade cable for each of your sensor reduce the inevitable mess of wiring another and i d wager even more important modification that this board have over the reference design be the voltage regulator rather than the lm7805 linear voltage regulator this use a mp2307 buck converter the spec sheet for this chip state usage up to 3a and 47523v operate range realistically it would likely be good up to 15a i have not push this board beyond this limit and 720v a state by the dc jack strangely the amazon description for this board mention 712v recommend but the buck converter can honestly handle more than that depend on your current load compare this to the uno r3s regulator which provide 500ma and can not really tolerate 12v input if your load exceed 230ma other noteworthy item include a 33v and 5v switch which make for even easy sensor compatibility and a a final bonus unlike most cheap uno clone this one use a actual atmega16u2 chip for usb interface rather than the cheap ch340 g chip i do have some issue with this board however build quality be only soso soldering quality be ok include component on board be high quality the issue be the actual placement of part can be a bit crook the header and dc jack be egregious example of this although shield fit fine it be very annoying when other component like the sensor pinout be perfectly align there be also some layout difference for realom the reference design which could affect your project enclosure etc the 16u2 icsp header be put where the reset button normally go the reset button be relocate to the end of the board there be also no crystal oscillator with a resonator be use for both atmel chip and perhaps most annoying it be miss the reference design mount hole next to the dc jack you can not really mount this board on 3 leg so i find this annoying enough that i end up drill my own hole finally the labelling for the pinout be very tiny and thin i think there be some space to label the pinout well or even just use elegoos method of print the label for the yellow stacking header on the outside of the board overall i really like this board it legitimately make project easy to handle and the buck converter make for piece of mind when connect multiple device hopefully keyestudios can improve their part placementsoldere accuracy and also update the design to include the mount hole,Good
this be a compact portable pa system that you can take anywhere it may be compact in size but not in sound this pa system be 600 watt the listing do say it be more but my system say it be 600 watt and 4 ohm that be the only reason i give this system four star it really do bring a ton of sound to any location it not only loud but the sound be clear it be very versitale there s not much this system can not do it include bluetooth that almost connect to your smart device without you move usb flash drive sd memory card reader and an fm radio you can connect and stream audio for realom other device use the rca jack it include a hand hold mic and a head phone mic and a remote control you can even do mp3 recording with the touch of one button on the back you can control treble bass and the echo there be separate volume for the microphone and the input the list of thing this system can do be endless i plan on use it a a pa system for a softball field they will be able to announce the player name and give play by play action comentary and play music during the change of the inning you can control all of this easily the coach can pick fun song for the gin real life to walk out to they be go to sound like a professional softball team if he want to never yell again at practice he can use the headphone mic to teach drill it hand for realee and clip onto a belt or pant the gin real life will be able to connect via bluetooth to listen to the music they want to for realom their smart phone during practice it be plenty loud enough to cover both the home and visitor side with clear crisp sound and i know the gin real life be go to love listen to great tune in out field it have wheel so they can easily bring it to the field and then back inside for safe keeping and charge overnight if they do forget to charge the system no worry it can be plug into an ac outlet i do not know if i ve cover everything that this power house can do i have give it a good try i think this be a great system with great sound i know we be go to enjoy use it for year i receive the pyle portable pa system at a promotional price to test and give an honest and unbiased review,Good

this be the second set of these usbpowered cool fan i ve purchase for realom amazon each time i combine they with a 4position usb switch sabrent 4port usb 20 hub with individual power switch and led hbumls on amazon so i could power they on and off independently of the computer usb port the first set be for a 10year old laptop dell inspiron 700 m that i mostly run plug into the wall outlet just for listen to the radio with the fan blow on the laptop it stay cool all the time the current set be for a brandnew laptop hp elitebook that i use dock most of the time the fan be very quiet quieter than the regular fan on my dell desktop and they put out a modest movement of air in one setup i have they side by side in the other one be about 4 behind the other mainly because of the physical desk layout not for any engineering reason real or imagine they do not seem to require a lot of power they re just plug into an ordinary usb port 20 on the old one 30 on the new one a other reviewer have note one side be open to the blade so it be possible to touch they if you re not careful they re soft plastic so they re not a great safety hazard but it be annoying to hear brup brup if you accidentally move a paper or cable into the path of one of the fan you could add a separate grill to the back or mount they on a panel but i just have they sit on the desk top they sit flat on any side there be indentation in the for realame that allow the power cable to be inset but it well to have they orient so that the power cable come out the top or side the cable material be pliable and the cable be long enough so they drape fain real lifey easily and do not push the fan out of position the box come with four selfadhesive rubber foot but they do not seem necessary,Good
partly why i go with the mobius camera be the ability to hardwire it into the fuse box i make sure first that i could buy all the appropriate material and this of course be top on my list the mobius run off of 5v i believe i just know it le than 12v so you need a voltage converter and that s exactly what this be instead of buy thing separately to make my own i just buy this little gem it plug into the mobius feed along the top of the headliner down the apillar and into the fuse box area it could stand to have a couple upgrade but for what it be it great pro i have a kia forte with a small fuse box area and i be able to find a nice resting spot for the converter box which be the big part of the whole kit i also have 2 fuse tap instal and rca cable tuck back in there so i definitely think this will work on most any car long usb cord i have plenty leave over when i finish run it for realom around the middle of the windshield across the headliner down the apillar and into the fuse box come with an inline fuse con the inline fuse be hard to open and do not seem to be very stable so long a i do not need to fuss with it too much i m not too worried but it just feel cheap i have other inline fuse i can add if need be the wire be very thin i think it would be 16gauge but it seem more like 2224 gauge can only buy one that have a usb that stick straight out be able to purchase one that have a 90 degree angle would be nice a to avoid need to purchase a 90 degree adapter overall i m pleased with this purchase i may need to fix the inline fuse eventually but i may not either way i have the material to do it update 121615 i ve have this instal for a number of month now and even purchase a second one for a second mobius dash cam install one be in a forte and the other a prius and it power on the mobius each time with zero problem,Good
i buy one of this for my home office and like it so much that i buy a second one a few day later to use behind the headboard in my bedroom these appear to be wellmade and be very attractive for surge protector i like that they re white rather than puttycolore and match the color of my trim and electrical outlet and i love the snazzy blue and green light but mostly i love have lot of extra surgeprotected outlet my decorastyle shape like a rectangular block rather than like a figure 8 receptacle do not have a central screw so i could not use the provide screw to attach these to the receptacle but both surge protector seem to stay in place without slip i like have the surge protector attach to the wall rather than a strip sit on the floor where they d be a nuisance for vacuum the two usb receptacle be very handy you can almost never have enough of these no matter what room you re in i ve only have these about a month and i have not have an electrical surge knock wood so i m take the surge protection capability on faith ill certainly report back if the surge protection fail,Good

the blue yeti microphone be a great choice if you want to have a high quality mic at a decent price the yeti have all the bell and whistle add despite it low price point inside of it there be three 14 mm mic which allow you to choose the pickup pattern that you want stereo omnidirectional cardioid and bidirectional there be a knob on the back with the pickup pattern on it to allow change a well a a gain knob above it the yeti also sport a 35 mm zerolatency output that can be use to monitor the mic a well a play sound for realom a computer there be a volume control knob for the monitor output a well a a mute button that mute the mic above it overall the construction of the yeti be pretty solid although the knob be all plastic and feel cheap than the rest of the build the stand include be okay for desktop use such a podcast or casual use but any professional use will require a mic stand which can be screw in the bottom use a standard 58 thread the mic be pretty heavy and large however so make sure the stand can support the weight with the large size there be limited choice when it come to shock mount but i do recommend use the yeti and yeti pro custom spider shock mount v the blue oem mount my picture include a link the noise to sound ratio be pretty high and the yeti will pick up a lot if the gain be too high i find have the gain just above minimum while stand about 12 in away for realom the mic about 8 in away for realom the pop filter if you have one be a good starting point for the good sound the sound be rich and be a good quality pro thanks certify changeable pickup pattern build in gain control mute button 35mm zero latency monitor out standard 58 thread screw for stand high quality sound and build quality con large in size heavy default stand have no where for a pop filter to attach very limited shock mount choice knob be a cheap plastic,Good
so let i start off by say that i work in it and i ve be build system for 15 year while i do not know everything about computer i do know how to build a pc after use this board for the last 4 to 5 month i purchase an additional hdd while i be try out a sata cable to make sure the length would work the actual sata connector on the board just pull right off i then notice that another sata connector have either fall off or be miss when i purchase it the connector be not even sautere to the board correctly i be able to just slide the connector that come off back onto the prong though i ve always purchase msi board in the past this one just happen to be on sale at the time i build this pc i will never purchase another gigabyte product again this board be build with cheap component and without any quality inspection,Bad
i be look for a 120 mm usb fan that i could pair with my old model roku xds streaming player 1080p they be the exact same size so this fan sit on top to pull hot air out of the unit picture above the fan be quiet and provide sufficient airflow to keep the roku cool i also consider thermaltake af0007 mobile fan 12 usb fan 120 mm diameter 47 height x 47 width x 10 depth but decide in favor of this one because 1 the coolerguys fan have a usb passthrough plug so you can stoday i learnedl connect your external hard drive or other usb device without disconnect the fan thermaltake instead have a retractable cord 2 the coolerguys fan have allblack construction and do not stand out for realom the rest of my equipment thermaltake instead have bare metal attachment 3 the coolerguys fan come with 4 rubber foot that you can stick to bottom of the fan when it be mount horizontally thermaltake instead come with a vertical stand 4 the thermaltake fan come with a speed adjustment knob but i decide that i do not need it because i figure that either fan would already be quiet enough without be slow down i also consider buy a standard 120 mm computer case fan usb or wall adapter but the pricing in either case be comparable to the above if i could change two thing 1 the sticky rubber foot they be fine if you do not intend to move the device but a well solution would be one that use the predrille hole in the corner such a the rubber pushpin or gasket that be normally use to reduce vibration when mount to a computer case that way you would not have to worry about the foot fall off and getting lose happen once during setup 2 fan grill 1 fan grill include only for the inflow side a 2nd fan grill for the outflow would be appreciate update 02082017 fan stoday i learnedl work use it now for a cable modem picture 2,Good

consider that every household have multiple smartphone and tablet regardless if it android or apple multiport usb charger become a must have gadget to save room since you do not have to deal with single port power adapter it work quite well in our livingfamily room where i need to use just one ac outlet to charge both of our smartphone my kid tablet their 3d and audio player but we stoday i learnedl run into a problem when we have to charge our camera battery or to plug in laptop printer or other home entertainment component it also become a problem in our bedroom where we have a typical 2ac outlet on each side of the bed next to the nightstand and both outlet be use for night lamp and alarm clock that s where we have to use typical power strip with 6 ac outlet for the lamp and the clock and usb charger this become messy with more wire and more charger the solution a smart power strip i just test for realom anker which combine 6 ac outlet with 4 usb port charger unbox unbox here be straight forward you get a sturdy easy to open box with anker logo and power strip inside with so many poor quality power strip i come across thin cable cheap plastic light weight it be nice to feel a heft of a solid build in my hand design there be nothing groundbreake about the design of power strip section where you will find 6 typical ac outlet with 15a fuse power switch circuitbreaker just enough to handle a typical wall ac outlet what stand out be the thick durable plastic housing enclosure which look like it can take a serious abuse if you drop it or kick it and a thick power cable to handle high current keep in mind the thick the power wire the low the gauge rating mean you can handle more current without overheat the wire one of the common fault because electric fire i also like how there be an attached velcro strip to keep cable organize for storage and to keep the cable length under control the groundbreaking part of the design be where you see the power strip extension accommodate 4 usb port with ankers iq power management which automatically adjust to the optimal speed of your charge device while supply up to 24a of current per port total combine of 6a i also like how when power be on you get a typical red light indicator for realom the power switch and also a green power lead indicator next to usb port great visual feedback that everything be on and operate ok charging obviously ac outlet be operate flawless space between port be enough for large power plug and everything feel solid when it come to usb charging i find it to perform identical to my anker and other brand multiport usb charger where i measure my note 4 to sink 173a of current at 518v between our note 4 and s5 and two nexus 7 tablet all device be charge at the max speed so no complaint here conclusion just like last year when multi port usb charger be see everywhere i m sure combined acusb power strip will gain their momentum in 2016 such power strip will be especially useful in the bedroom or next to your tvcablevideogame setup where you need to accommodate multiple ac power cable and also want to charge your microusb powered device this be also very useful when you be travel and have to deal with a limited ac outlet in a hotel room when it come to power strip it not just about find the good bargain but get it for realom a company you can trust that use quality material and actually stand behind their product and their design i would not trust buy cheap power product for realom a dollar store or noname product for realom ebay anker powerport strip offer a convenience of 6 ac outlet and 4 high speed usb port all power for realom a single ac outlet a a result you get all in one solution cover by ankers 18month warranty at a price of under 30 which be the same a you would pay for some multiport usb charger this one definitely get my recommendation,Good

i compare this to the razer blackwidow ultimate 2016 backlit mechanical gaming keyboard fully programmable tactoday i learnede clicky green switch and an amazon basic wireless keyboard setup time 15 minute you must unbox the keyboard and mouse plug in the unifor your informationng reciever and pair the mouse via bluetooth the keyboard must be connect to the computer via suplie microusb cable and then you must download the logitech option software and then pair the keyboard that way there be no way to pair the keyboard without download this software so be forewarn even if you plug the keyboard in with the microusb you can not use it without the logitech software which be a real downside for i the mouse be plug and play but the keyboard be not battery life 10 day fully charge for both keyboard and mouse seem like le with actual use though charge time for the mouse be 15 hour charge time for the keyboard be 4 hour ergonomics actual use keyboard the keyboard be a standard pc keyboard and not a mechanical one like the razer black widow there be a nice place to rest your wrist on the logitech which be miss on the amazon basic wireless keyboard see picture which be a huge bonus for type on your lap and be a thoughtful design option however the mechanical keyboard of the razer be much well for extended type this keyboard be good for type but more tiring over the long run a the key be short if you type a lot i would go for a mechanical keyboard the backlit keyboard be very nice and you can control the brightness of the lighting with the function key great for work in a dark office or bedroom the key be fain real lifey quiet the keyboard be the k800 if you want to look it up mouse this be a standard mx master mouse which i own also the mouse be right hand only the mouse be large with a pronounce arch and good for medium to large hand but not good for left hander and people with small hand like woman and child i think the logitech anywhere 2 be a well all around wireless mouse choice the amazon basic wireless mouse be very basic with no button on the side the mx master be a very good mouse and it even work on clear glass which i would expect of any logitech mouse in the box 6 foot micro usb cable 5 foot usb extension cord keyboard mouse manual overall the logitech mx900 bluetooth mouse and keyboard be a very good choice for wireless use but there be some disadvantage like the need to install the logitech software and the large size of the mouse if you be go to type a lot then a mechanical keyboard might be a well choice let i know if that be helpful thanks,Good

i have to put that qualifier right up for realont this microphone produce excellent quality sound and it pick up everything i use this for quite a few instructional course and it sound fantastic but i have to go into a really quiet room and do a lot of post production to get the sound i require the good your voice be very clear and bright microphone be boomy and deep for speak without overdo it if you stay the same distance for realom the microphone it very consistent it have a unique sound similar to much more expensive microphone it well build travel well have a lot of option for cartiod pattern and gain realtime listen with headphone work great the bad it pick up everything under the sun neighbor mow the lawn will sound like you re sit next to the lawn mower car drive by clothing movement everything you can turn down the gain on the mic but then you lose some of what make it great you can not really mount it on the table because the slight bump of the table sound like bus explode you ll need a pop filter they re cheap and well worth the investment with this microphone you get two option low gain average sound in a semi noisy environment or high gain beautiful sound in a quiet one prepare to do some post process the only reason i knock a star off be because it can be difficult to use for the average podcaster or home user it might just be too much it far too sensitive to background noise in my opinion and you can clean it up but that take a lot of time overall i stoday i learnedl recommend it especially if you have a quiet place to record your recording will be clear and pleasant to listen to,Good

in my search for an inexpensive entry level digital usb microscope i find thousand for sale on amazon i read many review and finally decide to give the plugable digital microscope a try here what i find at the 35 price point i certainly be not expect dinolite quality or performance but i must say that i be not disappoint the plugable be all plastic but appear to be reasonably well make it be easy to setup and get the software instal the driver and software be not include but there be a link to they in the include quick start guide i prefer to download software and driver to get the most recent version once the software be instal and the microscope be assemble on the stand just plug in the usb connection and you re ready to go the software be easy to use and appear to provide just about everything you need to make the most of the microscope you can take photo or video there be a button on the camera for photo but you can also click on the software button to take a picture since the microscope be so sensitive and can be easily move out of position i find it much more beneficial to take photo by click the button in the software fact v fiction the spec state that the microscope will provide 10x to 250x magnification i do not see any way to vary the magnification so i contact customer service they tell i that the magnification depend on the distance the microscope be for realom the object in conjunction with the focus ring it somewhat confusing and take getting use to but you will get interesting result in reality there be no way to even come close to guess what magnification you re at i have include some photo of a quarter at various magnification a i say it just a matter of move the microscope close to the quarter and focus accordingly if you place the microscope right on the object and continue turn the focus ring towards the you will get two focus point the late one be the high magnification possible hopefully the photo will demonstrate what i m talk about overall if you just want to have some fun and you re not do serious research or lab work this be worth a try it will not break the bank and it fun for kid of all age i m 63 retired and always look for new toy i do have to contact customer service regard a minor issue i be have with the software sam the customer service rep be very patient and knowledgeable and stay with i untoday i learned he reach a satisfactory resolution his customer service make this purchase well worth the very reasonable price,Good

inithanks in advancel impression be a very nice monitor i m happy with it so far one issue with it be that there be only one button that be the onoff button and mode button it be possible to control brightness and contrast a well a a low blue mode what i like most about this monitor be that there be only one usbc cable for power and video this mean i do not have to search for another power outlet to plug my monitor into also the thin form factor make this monitor very easy to transport i notice that this monitor be within a hair of the same length a my laptop but it be not quite a wide so i just stack the monitor on top of my laptop when i pack it into my laptop pack i m write this review after just a few hour of use these be my inithanks in advancel impression that i hope will continue to be last impression if i encounter any issue i will update this review at that time,Good
when it come to usb drive we often time do not think too much about they they be at one point a mere way to exchange information between rig or carry document with we on a keychain for realom home to work a time go on they evolve in to transferable medium style application that we can plug into tv and use to watch low resolution video a well a share picture for realom or use to play music medium the jump to high resolution and large file size bring demand for high performing device the struggle be balance a reasonable price to what the product have to offer new standard of usb evolve and release in time bring new usb device counterpart to compliment they the patriot supersonic rage 2 offer a little more than expect after testing and at half the price of the kingston hyper x savage after my experience with the rage 2 it become a no brainer they can both do the same thing but the rage 2 have a little more under the hood while it do drag in some area than the hyper x the hyper x 80100 price tag for the same 128 gb make i question how good kingston think their product really be if that sound challenge it be mean to it feel like an alcohol mark up with the rage 2 be close in price to a 128 gb ssd and with fain real lifey comparable performance on the surface the rage 2 boast 400200 seq read and write speed usually in my dealing with sequenthanks in advancel readwrite speed labeling we see more of a theoretical rounding of the number an ocz trion 150 ssd for example boast 550r520w and this be the top of the 25 non never minde readwrite speed for an ssd i have one of these and i clock it with crystal disk more realistically at 490440 these be stoday i learnedl good number toshiba do not lie about it max capability since it be near the ceiling a be but my point be usually you expect the number to be low and round up for advertising purpose that be say the rage 2 clock on crystal disk 402 read and an astounding 372 write this be far great than a advertise on the sequenthanks in advancel write portion and just above a advertise on the read portion now this be applicable use 31 gen 1 if you attempt to get these speed via a hub over a distance or in a non 31 s 10gbs interface you will not achieve this cool so what do this mean for people if you want a high perform medium usb for a reasonably awesome price the rage 2 be that i instal game onto it after format it to ntfs create a root steam folder save the game to it i experience lowmoderate load time in game well than my firecuda sshd and now have some of my game off pc and on their own well perform uncluttered drive this can be useful for you a well if you have a gaming laptop with a 31 usb or go to a buddy house and want to port your game with you some tweak of a directory will need to be perform but it be simple and quick saving and watch large uhd file be easy and with enough space for some movie it be great for take with you on flight or trip so that you have a medium library on the go most of the medium should stream off of the usb fine even with 30 usb interface i do a simple heat test with my finger after play some game off of it for a while there be no need to test far after touch it it be just barely warm than room temperature notably warm but not like oh wow that be getting warmhot it stay very cool impressive my silicon power 30 usb drive heat up like an oven when move video file back and forth but the rage 2 stay super cool under stress load whatever patriot do to accomplish this kudo while i do not think they use a specific plastic or coating it be well encapsulate and this may add to assist in cool idealistically it be design to complement the 31 type a port if you be look to do thing such a game for realom usb it a neat and fun toy to have and may be perfect for you if you be someone that just need a portable drive for small everyday thing save a few extra buck this usb be a solid product pack with feature unseen by most not look that for the price be pretty stellar not all usb drive be create equalor sell equal and it be apparent with what patriot be able to accomplish here where the drive fall behind be the random readwrite testing i can honestly say it be fain real lifey predictable that it would low random speed can impact performance but a far a i be able to determine nothing noteworthy in real time other feature of the drive be it compact slider add to it self discretion desire by most the drive have a micro loop to place it on a keychain or lanyard not include the small size and look i prefer over the large in your face overly brand kingston hyper x savage the cherry on top be a five year warranty that tell i patriot be confident in the rage 2 and convey confidence to i i will likely outgrow this drive before it end of day be meet i would recommend this drive if anything i describe above be what you be interested in this type of usb drive be not only super affordable for what it have to offer even for the every user but give the more enthusiastic a fun new device to add to their arsenal i hope this be somewhat helpful good luck,Good
i actually buy those verbatim store n go 8 gb usb drive for realom a big discount chain that sell lot of cheap junk give their low cost i do not expect they to be top performer stoday i learnedl i m disappoint readwrite speed i benchmarke the drive on an usb 20 port run crystaldiskmark 301 x64 sequenthanks in advancel read1495mbs write42mbs see the screenshot i upload for detail both read and write speed be very slow by today standard i also test copy 48 mp3 file total 375 mb into this drive it take 114 second which mean an average write speed of just 33 mb mechanical construction the drive have a retractable sleeve design but there be no lock mechanism i need to hold firmly under the usb drive when insert into an usb port otherwise it retract back into the sleeve and do not make electric contact i think i can just use the usb drive without the retractable sleeve but after i pop the drive out of the sleeve i m shocked to see the internal component expose see the picture i upload and you ll understand so i have to push it back again bottom line the product do work a an usb flash drive but it readwrite speed be too slow and the mechanical design be poor i consider it an okay product hence the 3star rating but can not recommend it,Average

i buy this surge protector to use with my laptop which come with 2 bonus usb hook up for charge usb device some mp3 player and cell phone etc pro the plug swivel 360degrees and lock in with a push of a button easy to recycle minimal cardboard packaging con it rather large to carry in a laptop sleeve although it come with a plastic plug protector that double a spacer to balance it against the wall this be also supposedly help protect thing for realom getting scratch i think it a design flaw if the plug be make flush with the unit instead of stick out 38 or 10 mm the spacer would not be necessary which would also allow for a more compact design though my old apc surge protector be dedicate only for plug in my laptop ac adapter in comparison it be much slim and compact in conclusion this unit be great for travel if you want to hook up various device but if you just need to plug in your laptop then i d go with something much small apc notebook surge protectorsnote there be a 2 or 3prong version so check to get the right one or belkins f5c791c8 the main body measure d x w x l approximately 50 x 40 x 125 mm or 20 x 15 x 60 but if you include the plug it extend a little past 4 instead of 2 or 10 mm instead of 50 mm this unit be make in china,Good
