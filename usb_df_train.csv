crystal disk mark sequenthanks in advancel read and write 300mbs and 115 mb respectively which be about 25 slow than advertised real world read performance be slightly to significantly slow 270 170 mb not sure why such variability real world write performance be slightly slow 130mbs write on average this be all with highly uncompressible datum if i have to buy again would go for 64 gb version which be fast,Good
this device be a solid option for anyone look for a nice look usb 30 hub it attain a similar look to apple product and will look good in almost any setup the 3 usb port and card reader be convenient for my setup so i do not have to reach around to my computer and hook up more stuff and it also add additional usb port and a card reader it have be work good for i with no issue seem of solid construction with a pad at the bottom to make it stay without move around also have over voltage protection which be always a nice feature to have after run some test with an ssd plug into the hub i be get really good speed upwards of 525mbs which be the same a it be hook directly to the motherboard i just plug it into my pc and it work right away only issue i have be that the cable be a little to short to hook up for realom back of pc to for realont of desk but it stoday i learnedl of decent length pleased with it so far and it seem like a good product,Good
this thing be nice i have yet to use it while solder a the device i need to solder have well already be solder not sure how well i m stoday i learnedl wait on part there be no zoom only focus,Good
i actually purchase this mainly to cool my phone while it be charge it can get over 110f and it do a wonderful job the package come in quick even though i do not use amazon prime this be the 7 plastic version i m note this because occasionally when i turn it on there be a audible plastic rattling sound it not super loud though which sound like it come for realom the for realont grill it go away if you move the fan a bit which be only hold on by four screw that make the fan easy to clean when you need to disassemble the grill the cord be a good length runner usb which be a decent thickness the fan be very quiet when it on it barely a hum in term of volume the air flow be also great the breeze be able to be feel for realom three foot away the switch be easy to reach there be up and down today i learnedt on the fan no panning leave to right i do notice my fan have some paint either miss on the motor housing or white paint be accidentally splash onto it either way it a very minor cosmetic touch that i barely notice there be also no high low medium etc speed it on or off for 7 and change i can not not recommend this to someone look for a small quiet fan that run off of usb power,Good
do not work for i i have a 2017 macbook pro that i need this in order to convert my audio interface ua apollo twin thunderbolt 2 cable into usb c it do not work my system would not recognize my interface i figure maybe this be only for display and i make a mistake so i connect my rocketfish hdirect messagei displayport adapter to it and my mbp would not send a signal to my monitor either not sure if it break or if it just limit a to what you can actually use it for,Bad
this be an incredible speaker and one that i use pretty much on a daily basis the sound quality be so great and although it be a compact speaker the sound quality it produce penetrate my entire house i be very hesitant when it come to get speaker online because many of the speaker i have purchase in the past for realom other company have have either really bad sound quality or have stop work after a few try but with this speaker it have not be the case at all and i would absolutely recommend it for anyone look for a portable speaker at a great price sound quality one of the thing i love most about this speaker be the awesome sound quality i have literally play do not start to get static when i raise the volume to it maximum one of the issue i have with my old speaker be that i would always hear a strange static noise once i raise the volume too high but i have not have that issue with my soundbot speaker and i be very happy because that would get quite annoying sound awesome in the shower or when expose to water in general the sound quality be not jeopardize when it hit the water and it sound just a great in and out of water durability this speaker be extremely well engineer and it be evident that it be make to last the grey outer she will be make of hard silicon that protect not only the device but also the actual speaker for realom any fall or rattle the central part of the speaker be protect by an aluminum mesh material that allow for the sound to penetrate a long range lightweightportable i can literally take this speaker and anywhere and everywhere with i i recently take it to the beach with i and just throw it in my beach bag and it be a hit with all my family member they love how awesome it sound about the size of my palm so it be not extremely big nor extremely small just the right size to carry around suction cup stick to just about any plastic metal glass i like to keep the speaker in my car so that i could just listen to my own music wirelessly rather than have to listen to the radio all the time connectivitybattery life connect instantaneously i have never have any issue with connection and after i connect it to my hone the first time my phone recognize the device immediately and automatically connect to it after that once i turn it on the speaker be rechargeable and bring the usb charger so no battery neeeded woohoo like i say i use my speaker on a regular basis and have only have to charge my speaker once since i get it the battery life last about 46 hour before i have to recharge it can play music while charge the speaker overall i really love this speaker and have find it to be nothing le than amazing i be really happy with the speaker and how user for realiendly it be this speaker truly offer awesome quality at a great price,Good
the standby after ten minute may have contribute to massive filesystem corruption that be discover right after the unit power back up on access o be win10 drive be set to optimize for performance so write caching be enable write caching be enable because i be transfer a ton of small file to the drive in the cabinet and do so will write caching reduce performance to a crawl the xfer have occur and it be about a day after the xfer that the filesystem corruption across all the drive be find okay so i contact the company and ask for instruction to disable the standby feature they send a firmware file with instruction to reprogram the firmware one step in use the programmer be to specify the minute untoday i learned standby 0 or zero for disabled also i think it be a requirement of the programming software to use an old like xp pc it do not work on win10 for i i have to use an xp notebook i have for these sort of occasion i do it for a living note that the firmware they send i be date 102320140435 pm 49408 byte and filename jms567pspmv9029 bin so almost a couple year old on the replacement firmware reprogram use it anyway and set standby to 0 seem to have defeat that feature interestingly enough now the drive enumerate differently previously the drive have enumerate a scsi device now they re enumerate in device manager with their manufacturermodel another interesting tidbit be that previously with the shipping firmware i be get quite a few event 153 warning log in the event viewer on the win10 box event 153 be the io operation at logical block address 0x613737 for disk 3 pdo name device0000007c be retry type stuff this would occur during heavy io and like i say there would be many consecutive warning sometimes 12 dozen with the replacement firmware send to i with instruction for disable standby i m no long get those warning i be however get event 158 warning those be disk 4 have the same disk identifier a one or more disk connect to the system go to microsofts support website and search for kb2983588 to resolve the issue i be get the same warning under the shipping firmware i have contact the company ask for information that would explain the disk corruption whether other with the shipping firmware have experience the same issue the change in how drive enumerate scsi v manufacturer model in the shipping v replacement firmware the event 153 under the shipping firmware and the event 158 under both the shipping and replacement firmware and have not receive a response the concept be great but massive filesystem corruption would be a deal breaker i m do extensive testing of the replacement firmware but have some concern that the way the driver enumerate now indicate i may be limit in the drive capacity support ill cut the outfit some slack a there be no doubt some language barrier these unit use jmicron controller and it would be nice if jmicron would write something up indicate the difference in firmware and operation the picture i ve attach show device manager with shop hidden device check so you can see the way the drive originally enumerate a scsi v the way they now enumerate,Average
it work smoothly the write speed be not the fast compare to some in the market but with only a 200 gb hard drive it not like you ll be write massive amount of datum to it on a regular basis but it so much nice than back everything up to cddvd like i use to it just a simple click and drag with my mouse i can finally have peace of mind know that everything be now back up the good part be that all you need to do it quickly plug the usb in no power cord to get all tangle with everything else,Good
after browse arround small ac usb wifi adapter i find this one that have no review so far i m very impressed speed be good and the range be fine i m upstairs and get great signal i have be transfer file back and forth on my lan and it do not overheat like some of the other device so far pic show average lan transfer speed on 5gh ac network for realom a wired source router be a netgear nighthawk 1900,Good
i buy this case for my first pc build so i m new to this the case come in perfect condition but the plastic cover the window be not line up correctly on the inside panel not a big deal the only thing that i do not like too much be that there be no wiring grommet to hide the wire and a little more and offer more protection for realom the case but for a budget case i think it great i will update this review once my build be do and i have all my part update now that i ve have the case for a while i stoday i learnedl like it but i m find one big issue there really be not much room for the power supply behind the drive bay i have a fully modular evga super nova 850w gold and i have to bend my cable sharply to get it inside the case by do this it very easy to accidentally pull out a cable for realom the mobo or the psu itself,Good
i get this for for realee a a backup to the original apple mll82amausbc charge cable 2 m that come with my apple macbook pro mlw72lla 154inch laptop with touch bar 26ghz quadcore intel core i7 256 gb retina display silver it be much heavy and sturdy than the apple charge cable and it be also short by 2 meter which do not seem like a lot but if it not what you re use to it certainly make a difference it come in for realustrationfor realee packaging so it easy enough to get in and out of the box a usual the quality do not disappoint but the price do it actually more expensive than the apple charge cable list at 19 but a few dollar more on amazon so i d have to recommend go with apple cable a it also support charge usbc device and work for sync and datum transfer,Good
let i start off by say i be use this on 2 different macbook pro run macos high sierra this adapter work perfectly once i instal the correct driver the driver offer on the include disc do not work you must go to the driver download page on the asix website to get the late driver amazon will not allow direct link to external website you will need to search for ax88179 on the site i download and instal apple mac o x 106 to 1012 driver installer revision v290 release on 20170426 once instal and my mac restart the usb gigabit device appear in network preference i have 1000mbps up and down fiber to the home usually i get much more on the dl side but when i run the test i do not limit other service primary pick this up to use for full time machine backup on my local network to the drive attach to my airport extreme base station a it be much fast than back up 300400 gb over wifi,Good
small and otg readyperfect for usb c phone use it with my nexus 5 x 16 gb and pixel xl 32gbnow i can carry all the medium i need only flaw be that the cap that close the usb c do not rotate all the way to close the usb 3 port it just stick out which make it look a bit odd,Good
love the 10 foot lightning charge cable for realom skiva there s a huge difference in the look and feel of this cable compare to the oem apple cable that be include with your apple device this cord be thick and the plug end be very heavy duty i have no issue with the cord charge my iphone 6 and my ipad mini it a mfi certify so that mean it recognize by apple device and there s no special software need very impressed with the high quality of this cord i love the 1 year warranty and the 10 foot cord length be awesome no more confinement of a 3 foot cord i purchase this cord at a discount price in exchange for my honest review,Good

this little cable be perfect for charge with a small external battery pack it work like a charm and provide a fast charge the cable be fold and loop into the tassel crimp with a metal strip nice quality no rough edge the usb side have 15 of flexible cable and the lightning side have 175 the color match the photo pretty well too you could bend the cable to plug one end into a computer or wall charger spread the cable out essenthanks in advancelly straight i would not do it a lot because the cable be fain real lifey stiff and bend it against the metal strip will only because wear on the cable i love the concept but it would be nice if the lightning cable have a tiny little attached cover so many cable fail on i due to damage to the connector itself that this be a disappointment especially give that this tassel be clearly mean to hang out and swing around for realee overall this be a great little cable it will dress up most bag even those plain black laptop bag and if it do not match the outside you can put it inside and easily find your cable in the depth of the bag,Good
great well make cable be sure which usb end you need the mini be the middle size usb plug there be also a micro which be small this be confusing to i at first reference the chart i include,Good
this be a pretty high quality usbtype c cable a the cord be nylon braid without the impression of be prone to for realay in the future the charge tip housing be metal and a nice silver color attractive and durablelooke the charge tip be not gold plate which be alright because that only really make minimal difference with audio cable this be a usb 30 cable and charge the new mac pro chromebook pixel and i believe a nokia n1 tablet quickly without issue this cord rival the quality of manufacturer like anker and will be essenthanks in advancel for the future of our device a everyone begin to make the transition to usbc for reversible purpose among other thing lastly the cord be about 3 foot which be more ideal for outlettodesk type of distance this be great for when you re not too far for realom the outlet and want to keep cable look clean if you need more cable length though i recommend look for 6 ft or long to be able to have more cord for realeedom all in all i recommend this product which be provide to i for realee of charge for evaluation purpose however i take review seriously and this remain to be an honest review for a product which i be happy use,Good

this be a review of the enfain 10 piece business card usb stick pack 8 gb they arrive neatly package in a box of ten each individually wrap each be about the size of a business card make of hard white plastic and slightly thick than a credit card the usb connector swivel out of the body of the card and the mechanism seem fain real lifey tough in use i do not have any compatibility problem pop the connector out insert it into your pclaptop and you should be all set to transfer datum tofor realom it it be unfortunately usb 20 only so speed be not brilliant i do a few run with diskspeedtest and see average read of around 28mbs and write of just under 8mbs not terrible but certainly far below usb 30 and it ll take a while to fill the full 8 gb these card be definitely not speed demon that s for sure they re great for give out to client with demo particularly if you brand the one side they be quite pricey though even the small 1 gb model be just under 250 so you would not be do this on a large scale they re great to keep in your wallet or purse though and the hard plastic should keep it safe pro great for hand out with demo or for marketing purpose convenient to keep in your walletpurse tough plastic exterior con only usb 20 overall this be a neat flash drive they can be use both to give to client a a demomarkete device but they re equally good to keep in your walletpurse it a pity that they re usb 20 though speed suffer a a result,Good

this next review have be kind of a difficult one to start because of how simple yet necessary of a product it be in this world of technology when mosdart ask if i would review their 64 gb usb30 high speed flash drive in exchange for a discount i know it would be something that would come of use and be sort of a necessity to have on hand work with a huge variety of phone tablet and of course laptop the usb flash drive quickly transmit datum wherever you need it and on the go hold a whopping 64 gb of memory and measure no big than a few inch long you can take your most prize file or something to keep the kid busy pretty much anywhere you need at first when this arrive we be not quite sure what we would use it for we just know we need to have it on hand but then we decide it would be perfect to load several kid movie and game to it for the kid to take with they to grandma the kid be thrilled they do not have to cart a huge bag last weekend and grandma be thrilled she do not have to be completely tech savvy to use it plus the kid keep busy while she do thing around the house,Good

and i ve see it sell elsewhere for a min of 150 if you know what you be get and be look at this model then you will not be disappoint if you be look at this because it a cheap double din and look good read the spec on the kenwood page this be an excellent midway double din stereo i get mine professionally instal so i could just go and not worry about break something it come with a wiring harness a toyotaspecific for realame plate a japanesegmc plate and a third generic plate i have a 05 mustang and this stereo look very tasteful and natural in my car i seriously consider an excelon series single din kenwood stereo but just could not get over the flashy youthricer look of the single din here is what make i choose this stereo i want ipod capability usb for good qualityauxiliary at the least a large enough screen so i would not squint while drive and definitely a sleekunderstated look here be some general feature of this stereo usb connectivity for iphone ipod and compatible usb mass storage device pandora connectivity sirius xm ready kenwood music control for android smartphones for realont usb and aux input 3x 25 preamp volt 15 display with 24 color choice for button backlight display lead dimmer control great for night drive steering wheel remote input interesting spec support file format wma mp3 aac 24bit digitalanalog converter usb port for realont aux input usb 11 20 full speed file system fat1632 preout impedance under 600 speaker impedance 48 there be several thing i really love about this particular stereo aside for realom it add to the appearance of the inside of my mustang in a classyslick kind of way there be a lot of customization option for audio quality do not like mess with treblebassmidsfaderbalance there be preset on the stereo for different type of music hear a fav dubsteprap song instead of change your custom audio setting go to the loudness bass booster option and crank it up for realom nothing to lvl 2 or 3 there be far advanced control which be beyond i but i know at the very least you will need a dedicated amp and good set of speaker to fully appreciate all the advanced setting you can tweak on your head unit if you just buy this head unit a a first step like i do fool around with the preset your basstreblemid and do not worry about touch the advanced stuff yet i also like that the dac digitalanalogue converter be 24bit they knock your sock off compare with use an ipod with an auxiliary cable sound quality wise it also a build in mosfett 4channel amplifier which provide at least a 4x improvement over your car stock setup the button on this device be solid and not crappy or cheap look they have a satisfor your informationng click sound and feel when depressed or tap the control knob be tickere every 10 degree or so that you rotate you hearfeel a tick sound very reassuring and allow for precise volume adjustment volume max be at 35 i actually like my music loud but i can not stand it much at 20 in fact i feel that 15 be pretty loud that leave 20 more value to go so there be a lot of potenthanks in advancel for this speaker if you like deafen music volume the bass option be very cool too i do not know my stock speaker be capable of such seatshake soundwave laughing out loud there be thing i do not particularly like with this stereo there be no hd radio build in not a big deal but i do love radio station on long ride and have cdquality music for realom station sound great but it do not come with this and the upper end model i also do not like that the pre amp voltage be only 25 the excelon series kenwood stereo have 4 volt pre amp the difference be a clean sound with le distortion when connect to an amp at high volume though this difference i have be tell be negligible only an extremely extreme audiophile can tell this minute difference many on popular autoaudio forum claim they can rarely tell the difference between 25 v 4 though your amp will provide an extremely important purchase later down the road lastly i do not like it when plug in an ipodiphone it immediately turn your stereo a the controller i personally like change my music on my ipodiphone not on the stereo itself not to mention it easy for passenger to handle an ipod than some foreign stereo device they ve never use before luckily there be an option to put the device inout of app mode which let you regain control of the handheld device that s pretty much it with the con they be minor and hardly worth mention please ask if any question update 42513 i find out how to change the color of the buttonsdisplay light you need to turn on the car fully turn on the stereo and in small silver print on the stereo plastic be say fcn press and hold that button for a couple second untoday i learned you reach a function control menu turn the dial untoday i learned you find the setting for color and select by press the knob then adjust to your heart content 24 choice,Good

shipping be super fast i receive it a day before everything fit perfect on my car the reason that i give it 3 star be because when you make phone call it lower the volume and you can not hear the other person very well even turn the volume to the max and that problem be not just in mine because i buy another one a couple day after and it be the same thing so it probably a factory thing i have another bos unit with the motorize screen and it sound perfect when you make call if they fix that problem then this unit it perfect for the price if you just want to stream music via bluetooth this be good for you but if you like to receive or make call while drive i suggest you to save some money and get something well,Average

this be a very handy microusb cable with a rightangle plug on the device end the cable itself be thin and more flexible than most usb cable so it much more pleasant to use with portable device the rightangle plug and cable do not project so far for realom the edge of the device so it almost ideal for my droid especially when it in the dash mount why almost ideal because the rightangle plug be lefthanded that be the cable point to the left when plug into the droid when hold sideways or to the top when the droid be hold upright my car power plug be in the center of the dash so it d be well if the cable point to the right for realom the driver side of the dash and when hold the droid upright i d prefer the cable point down so i wish there be a righthande version available but this be stoday i learnedl a much nice cable than those with bulkier connector and wire,Good

let face itit seem like there s more to do each day and le time to get it do if you want to have any kind of personal time you have to be able to multitask to get your 12 hour worth of work to fit into an 8 hour day for i to accomplish this i have set up my command center in my office and in my homebut what about when i have to hit the road it not like my job stop because i m in a hotel right this be where these monitor shine accord to the asus website the software for these will allow you to use up to 5 link with your pc i can not confirm this but i do have have 3 and i run they all along with my laptop display i can not quite work a efficiently a i be use to but it darn close i would recommend a few accessory if you want to do this however at first i try to make a mount system that would allow i to use 3 line up in portrait mode a i be use to on my desktop but then realize that this be not necessary i instead purchase a couple of mountera sidemount clip and a couple of anker aluminum stand and i m set the clip be large enough so that i can mount one on each upper corner of my laptop display and it will hold one monitor to each side and also one mount directly above my main display i use the anker stand to carry the weight of the monitor which be not much so that it do not drag down my laptop lid the monitor themselves be very lightweight thin and easy to pack and transport i slide all 3 of they into an amazon basic neoprene laptop sleeve 15 separate by 2 thin piece of pack foam cut to size the cable clip and stand all fit into the for realont pocket of my backpack set up take about 3 minute and i can go to town the color on these be pretty good they match up well with a little tweaking and a promise have good viewing angle the color be not a rich a on my main display but nothing to gripe about unless you be do photo editing all in all they be well worth the price i have the full hd usb 30 version although i do have a usbc port i do not want to have to worry about keep track of which be which the software that come with they be very easy to set up and once you do you can just use your window display setting to rearrange they a you like if you need full productivity on the go i would not hesitate over purchase these the time you will for realee up for yourself be worth the price hope this help your purchasing decision,Good

i want to be very clear that i be review the bos audio bvcp9675 this be the 350 dollar apple carplay compatible double din unit that do not have a cd player i know it can be confusing when amazon group hundred dollar head unit with top of the line item i have use other bos product before and they be fine mostly low end but decent quality for the money product the bvcp9675 be not like any other bos audio product i have use before and i will explain why it should be a consideration along with the other low cost carplay unit under 500 available today fall 2017 a of the time of this review sure the bvcp9675 lack a cd player and to be honest that s not a bad thing i do not own a cd player anymore all my music be play off my phone or my computer for those who need a disc player in their car there be plenty stoday i learnedl available for everyone else these new generation car stereo head unit be pack with so many other feature it really surprise i to be honest i be definitely not an expert when it come to review car audio but i do have the benefit of having own the pioneer sphda120 and i stoday i learnedl use it daily in another car i drive the pioneer unit be the low price carplay unit you could buy untoday i learned the sony xavax100 and this bos unit be release there may be other that i be not aware of i have not use the sony unit but i ve be use the pioneer unit for over a year and i have mixed feeling about it the build quality and sound quality be good but the interface be bad the only saving grace be the carplay which be standardize by apple so pioneer do not have a chance to mess it up i like pioneer but they be not good at user interface design and i always want more for realom their product stoday i learnedl for the price it be a good deal but can this bos unit compete with a big name brand like pioneer for 60 dollar le than the sphda120 at the time of this review the bos bvcp9675 really do offer some good competition build quality and feature be the good i ve see on a bos product and a soon a i open the box i could tell this be not the normal low end product for realom bos the price also reflect that with this unit be double to triple the price of other double din unit they offer installation be a breeze if you be experience with instal car audio everything be label well and i be able to replace my beloved old but age alpine head unit in my porsche cayman i have some hesitation put a bos unit into my admittedly old porsche but i feel good about the look of it when i open the box so i decide to give it a shot this unit have everything i need for realont rear and subwoofer preamp connector i plug those in attach my rear camera and solder the bos harness to my exist harness and i be up and run in no time the only big feature i do not use be the aux video input because it a 2 seater and i do not watch video when i drive that car and so i do not hook up the parking brake wire i also do not use the build in amplifier so i can not comment on how powerful it be but the unit boast an 80w x4 internal amplifier which be more than adequate to replace a stock head unit i also do not use the steering wheel control because my car be too old and do not have any but that be an include option and seem like a nice feature a warning message come on the screen for a few second then disappear so that s not an issue i be also not use any sort of 18 aux connector which be include and have a little cable that you can route to your dash for easy connection most people will connect via the bluetooth or the usb input there be 2 usb input one for carplay or hook up a usb drive or just charge your phone and the other one can connect to a usb drive or charge another phone i have not try connect an android phone but it work instantly with my iphone and the bluetooth be also very fast to connect it hard to explain this in the review but everything about the interface and the response time be very fast and it feel nice there s no lag when i hit a button on screen and everything be very responsive the screen itself be capacitive and work very well it all feel very high quality and nice remember this be bos audio we be talk about they be not know for their high quality stuff but this item be different the carplay interface be great and it work right away once you connect your phone if you receive a call or text it go through the carplay interface the stereo can read your text to you if you want a you drive you can use your map app and see where you be go a you listen to music it great this be also exactly the same on my pioneer unit so if you just want carplay on a budget this one definitely do the job the non carplay interface be something i never like with my pioneer unit so i be a little concerned with how it would look on this bos unit fortunately i be pleasantly surprised with the layout and design of everything everything be lay out almost like today i learnede that be easy to access but do not try to copy the apple look like so many other company do it have it own style and it be very clean look the radio work great and it immediately be able to lock in to my favorite station and within 5 second it display the artist and song on screen something my pioneer always struggle to do for some reason you can also access carplay if phone be plug in bluetooth phone call setting audio adjustment the rear view camera or the medium player which be the main feature right in the center you can select between aux in usb or bluetooth audio and it just work very well and without have to figure out where stuff be finally i want to touch on the soft button that be on the left of the display the pioneer have this same concept but i think bos do it well the bottom leave have a mute key that be always there and that be very important the pioneer require you to first hit volume down then press the mute key which be annoying if someone be try to communicate with you and you need the sound down fast that dumb mute button also cover up other thing on the screen which be annoying when you do not want it so i m so happy bos have make a dedicated mute button so that s the very bottom the other button be volume up and down bluetooth and home that s it it lay out really nicely and it very clean look the button be default scroll through different color but you can choose a color in the setup menu i usually just pick a color that match the rest of my car light and leave it but there be several option depend on your preference ok i think i ve say enough nice thing obviously there be some thing i do not love about this unit i feel that the 3 band equalizer be too basic and there be no way to adjust the crossover for realequency or the width q of each band so they be lock at 100hz for bass 1khz for mid and 10khz for high at least the mid adjustment be there because it give i enough to work with to give a clean tone for realom my speaker you can also turn the eq totally off there be a separate subwoofer control that allow you to set the crossover point for realom 80 to 160hz and it have a sub volume control so you can match it to your other speaker it basic but it work the big gripe i have with this unit be the logo screen that appear when you first turn on the car it do this crazy bos animation and it only last a few second but i do not like it the pioneer be much well in this regard because it allow you to upload your own image for realom a usb drive which be a nice touch i look over the user manual several time and i do not see any way to disable the loading screen or change it with my own image there be a menu which allow you to select different image but it do not seem to do anything for i maybe i be just miss it overall the bos audio bvcp9675 be a great apple carplay unit for the price it good quality and it sound good for the price it have a lot of feature and although i do not like everything i like almost everything and to i this be worth 5 star consider the price it might seem expensive but a carplay unit go this one be a bargain i m really impressed that bos audio a company know for it low end and entry level product i have a 50 dollar bos subwoofer amp for example make this really nice double din unit i will definitely be keep an eye on they for more product like this in the future update sept 26 2017 i have the opportunity to take a road trip this past week and get a good 20 hour of drive time with this bos unit i notice a couple thing i want to add to my review this unit work perfectly with io 11 i notice some other carplay unit do not work with io 11 currently so i think i d mention that apple map work great and it be improve for io 11 and show you which lane to be in the way google map have do for a while now i wish i could use app like waze but for now carplay just use apple map for gps i also be able to load up the mlb app and listen to a baseball game a i drive very cool other than that everything work a intend the system never get hot or do anything weird even after be on for 10 hour straight i m very happy with this unit do not be scare off because it be not pioneer or kenwood or sony or alpine i ve be kind of a snob about those brand in the past so this have be refor realeshing for i to try this brand and really enjoy one of their product,Good

this device play music for realom one of five source a standard sd card a micro sd card a usb thumb drive for realom it own build in fm radio or for realom an external device plug into the 18 inch mini jack cable include the sd and minisd card be fully recess into the device when play a nice touch that prevent accidentally snap a card in half it also have a headphone jack that silence the speaker when use it can also be use a a voice recorder yield dictation quality recording the build in lithium battery charge in an hour or two for realom any usb power source use a standard mini usb cable supply it run about eight to ten hour on a charge depend upon volume level and whether you leave the display on with external power the device will run continuously the clock read only 24 hour time mean three pm be display a 1500 instead of 300 i do not try the build in alarm clock function but it can also be set to turn off the device after a preset duration of 10 to 120 minute once you have your mp3 or wav file on your data card of choice the basic play and volume function be simple to operate for realom the for realont panel button turn the unit on for realom the switch in the back and it power up in a few second and start play for realom wherever you leave off the first song if you never use that card before the power switch do not turn off the unit if the unit be power for realom an external source so you have to press and hold the menu button to shut it off you can not address music file and folder directly you must skip ahead or backward one file at a time this be the only weakness in the design accessing and understand the menu be easy if you have use similar device before but might be confusing to someone who buy this a their first digital music player there s a certain logic to digital player menu and once you ve learn it on a similar device this one be easy to follow twin speaker be locate on the side of the unit for decent stereo separation on a device this small the sound quality on the build in speaker while lack bass for obvious size reason be crisp clear and certainly loud enough to make fellow worker in adjacent cubicle ask you to lower it please i can hear it fine on my boat when run at low speed the bass be a little thin using headphone but you can change the eq in the menu to compensate somewhat for the build in speaker the default eq set sound well the build quality of this player be well above what be expect it be put together well and feel rather solid it do not say make in china and do not say where it be make i drop it on the pool deck and not only do it continue work there be not a mark on it for it intend use a a portable personal player you ll find yourself use it a a travel radio a pool radio a desktop player at work or at the beach it nice not to have to be constrain by headphone to listen to music on the go and this device give you much more than it price tag take away,Good
original on the first day of use this product the black piece break off the adhesive i ve try to put it back together but it refuse to actually stick enough for actual use update 1 originally a 2 star but i m change it to a 1 star because the vendor send an email bie and moan about how i leave a negative review with the nerve to think that i would change it congrat because i m change it and it just get bad maybe if they run a respectable business operation the first few review would not be for realom people who get the product for for realee or for a discount update 2 after some reflection i decide that i should not let the vendor unethical behavior reflect my review on the product so i be go to change the review back to it original 2 star rating,Bad

let i start by say the only reason i buy these speaker be because the audio jack on my computer be break so i be force to use speaker that have sound go through a usb cord unfortunately there s not much of a selection for usb speaker that be suitable for use with a desktop pc and this be one of the few i could find a other reviewer have point out the volume adjustment with these thing be really bad set the volume on the low possible setting will be too loud put it one bar lower and the sound be off this be the main reason why i give these speaker 2 star also no volume control dial and no headphone jack on the other hand the sound quality be surprisingly good for 10 speaker these speaker be extremely small much more small than the picture would suggest and they look almost comical next to my 22inch monitor a i say before i only buy these speaker because the sound go through usb and my audio jack be break if you do not need sound to go through usb i suggest you look elsewhere a nearly every other speaker system be well than these,Bad
i see another review for realom cjguiser about the backpack he inithanks in advancelly receive not be water resistant so i decide to give it a test and i m not sure what the seller definition be for water resistant but to i the result show the bag be definitely not i simply fill a spray bottle with water and start spray towards the bag i focus on both the surface and the top zipper line where the rain would most likely enter water be be lightly spray onto the bag so i d consider it a fair test there s no jetlike water stream inithanks in advancelly the surface get easily soak a more and more water be spray over the bag within only a matter of second see attach photo however the inside seem to be fain real lifey dry i have a few sheet of paper towel stuff in the inner pocket of the bag and they all seem to have stay dry but the outside be definitely not comfortable to touch due to all the water absorb by the she will fabric i do not think the surface have any water repelling coating either then i concentrate the spraying mostly on the top simulate how the bag would encounter water in a typical rainy day i be mostly test to see if the water can easily pas through the zipper line but that do not seem to be the case however after a couple of minute i could see wet mark start to spread on the liner fabric inside the bag see attach photo in every compartment that mean if i have this bag with i on a rainy day everything inside the bag would basically be surround by water and moisture in maybe just 10 minute i m not sure about you but those result do not show anything water resistant to i also cjguiser review mention heshe receive a replacement bag after leave the bad review and the bag come with an extra waterproof cover in the bottom and have well bottom padding i check mine there s no waterproof cover and the bottom padding be nonexistent the bottom side feel like 18 of the thickness of the side of the laptop compartment,Bad

after upgrade my early 2011 macbook pro with a new solid state drive i need an enclosure for the old hard drive thunderbolt equip enclosure be too expensive so i look for firewire fw variant and find this nice 25inch hdd enclosure by owc it be almost all plastic but it feel quite solid and i dig the old mac g4inspire design the adhesive foot pad raise the enclosure just high enough for heat to dissipate for realom the enormous heat sink attach to the bottom of the hard disk tray it be a bit large than i expect but the build quality be very good and it run quiet and without issue connect to my aging macbook pro fw port instal the hard drive be not a complicated affair but the back plastic plate be a tight fit so i have to be careful when push it in it could prove difficult to remove should i want to replace the drive some day a expect data transfer speed be much fast with fw and support for usb 30 mean that i m cover for any laptop i m plan to buy in the near future owc include necessary cable screw foot pad and even throw in a faux leather carrying case the screw require a 0 phillip screwdriver honestly i really could do without the case if that would of shave some off the price but stoday i learnedl even with a new hard disk it be stoday i learnedl le expensive and offer more option than the thunderbolt compatible enclosure that i ve see out there overall i be happy with my purchase very recommend,Good
this thing be tiny i be not sure how it would fit into a usb port but it slide right in with no problem and take up about half of the port it stay in snug just like a regular flash drive the first thing i do be load a bunch of file onto it it amazing that consider the size of this flash drive it hold 8 g that s huge i load almost 7 g of file on to it right away and it be a little slow but that s because of how much i put on it in that first use the product detail claim that the flash drive be waterresistant since i m a vine reviewer and it my job to test the item i get i take the flash drive and fully submerge it into a cup of water for 5 second i dry it off and then plug it back into my computer my comp have no problem read the flash drive and i randomly pick a few file to open no corruption the product also claim to be traveltough the flash drive well be tough because the microchip portion that plug into the usb be expose constantly there be no cover at all to protect it i keep a flash drive on my key at all time and this micro one be go to replace my regularsize flash drive if anything ever happen to the micro flash drive i will come back and update my reviewbut if it can stand a good dunk i think it ll be ok with constant abuse a a keychain i seriously think the only way you could ruin this thing be by flatout lose it it so compact and tiny that step on it or drop it probably will not because any damage at all i be definitely impressed and i would recommend this to anyone,Good

i use this adapter during a 2 month trip in china and taiwan and it work very well it cleverly design compact and appear to be make with quality material it have surge spike and overcharge protection which many other adapter do not offer additionally the two usb port prove very useful for charge my camera battery and kindle reader at the same time that my laptop be be charge perhaps the good reason to buy this adapter though be for the excellent support when i first try use the adapter in shanghai i be confuse by the instruction on pac2gos website about which plug to use i call the support number and while wait for a connection realize it be 2 am in the usa before i could hang up someone answer the phone it be roger brinkley of pac2go who be work late despite the time roger be very gracious and eager to lend assistance eventually help i to figure out which plug to use for your information if travel in china and the electrical outlet look like the one in the picture below then you should use the eu plug and insert it into the top two bowler hat shape outlet roger say i could have also plug the usaaus into the same two outlet though i do not try do so,Good
this be a amazing medium player unlike most medium player like this one it do not require you to know japanese to set it up in fact there be not even a setup need this medium player do not have a max size limit on external drive and usb thumbdrive unlike alot of other player so you can even use terabyte size drive if you want the external drive do not require a power source plug in outlet so usb powered drive work just a well a power cable drive unlike the other medium player you ll find this play all file type not just the common avimp4 mkv ect all file type play with no slowdown the screen size can be change to different mode include default widescreen and full screen ect with the remote a well a several audio option all file can be organize in various folder and easily browse through for realom the medium player menu option with the remote very easy hookup you use a hdirect messagei cable not include which be all you need to hook up to the tv or monitor the power cable be the only other chord to hook up and your ready to use the medium player the instruction english only be great and make a easy to hook up device even easy and i always dislike hook up thing to the tv the picture and music work great and be a cool thing that will probably be use more than i expect to i really like the ability to have one item play all the medium you could want on your tv my favorite thing about this be the small size my other medium play be about 4x this size this can fit in the palm of your hand pretty easily it save a lot of room and give anyone the ability to have it without try to find a space for it i do like this remote well than my other medium player also it be big and use normal aaa battery not include instead of the watch batterie my other one have this be a great medium player and i be glad i own it but personally my other one may stay hooked up in my main room while this one be in another room it work just a good but the fact it only have one way to be hook up to a tv which be the hdirect messagei cable my tv have all of those input fill i will recommend buy amazon basic hdirect messagei cable to anyone that do not have a set for this they be very cheap and work a great a 100 one the customer service be amazing and ship the item very quickly i fully support this item and seller for the around this price you can get one a good that will include hdirect messagei cable but it will be a way big one take up a lot of room and possibly be in japanese untoday i learned it set in your language notice sometimes i get offer a small discount for my writing skill i be not a pay reviewer like amazon review team for amazon item i be not pay or give stuff to mislead or favor item like they if regular reviewer do that for a nonamazon sell item they be ban so support real seller that get honest review,Good
i ve build computer for the well part of 2 decade and can say that i enjoy the experience of use this case i have to switch to a nonmodular design power supply due to the lack of space but that be not a bother a i have one not be use i would love to see more place to put ssd a there be currently just one but i make due have the ability to remove both side be huge in matx case but the fact that the top and for realont be nearly totally accessible due to a hinge case design be something i could do in all the other case i ve use it truly make work with it fun i do wish the window be clear instead of blue but the blue hue do manage to show le of the scratch i ve grow to expect on this type of panel so that s a plus i suppose if you take your time and have some brainsimagination then you ll have no problem that you can not overcome pro small formfactor side panel top panel and for realont panel all removable topfor realont also on a hinge which allow easy access to everything great airflow due to meshtype panel windowe panel on both side con crappy include case fan that s too fat to fit in the extreme for realont very minimal amount of space next to the hdd cage where the psu cable begin only a single spot for mount ssd blue color window rather than clear bottom line here be that if you re look for a case for a matxitx build then this be not only please to the eye but pleasing to the builder in relation to the process of build i simply enjoy work in this case the pro far outweigh the con in this case guy and gal for 60 you can not go wrong,Good
a far a this adapter be concern it perform just a it be intend to do and more the reason why i give it 5 star be because it connect to the internet it small enough to hide out and it connect and surf the internet fast than i think it would besides connect to the internet this adapter can be place in the back of your pc if you want to hide it or if you want to have it visible you can place it on the for realont of your rig in addition a you connect it you will notice that your web surfing be just a fast a an ethernet connection for i i use my phone datum to get onto the internet a i start to use the internet i notice that my surfing be go really fast to i this be a big shock a i be not expect much speed for realom the adapter google and yahoo open up really fast to my surprise and online gaming have no lag effect what so ever in the end this adapter be definitely worth the price to get you on the internet pro connects to the internet pro it small enough to hide pro it connect and surf the internet real fast con i do not have one,Good

this be probably a steal in usb digital microscope con minor usb cable do not stay in the post see review pro solid metal base excellent oncamera focus and stand mechanical zooming excellent software everything work i previously review a le costly usb microscope also for realom ebo trade direct which i give very poor mark i would have stay away for realom this one be it not for the excellent and numerous review this particular model get for realom my experience with the former microscope i be aware of what work well in term of design and what do not what attract i to this model be that it have a vernier dial adjustment build into the mount this be one of the problem with the previous model i try there be no reliable way to adjust the camera distance without severely because the image to go out of focus or completely out of the field of the lens this model suffer for realom none of those issue after mount the camera body to it holder and mount it to the stand i be able to focus on tiny object much more easily and with significantly le mechanical disturbance keep in mind that when focus in one something tiny with any microscope the slight movement can affect the ability to focus this be similar to try to focus use a zoom lens at maximum zoom the slight movement of the camera can alter the ability to stay focused of significance with this microscope be that the oncamera builtin focus perform a fine focus and the vernier dial on the stand mount perform a rough inout focus in addition the position of the camera on the stand can be move either up or down to get close or far away for realom the object to facilitate focus in combination with the oncamera fine focus and the vernier inout adjustment for rough focus overall there s lot of control over the image with the ability to position the microscope use the fix position the finefocus and the variable inout rough focus i should mention that the software say it compatible with both window and mac i use window 7 64bit pro and instal the microscope to work with my computer be extremely simple and fast the usb microscope work the first time a soon a the software be instal the install process on window be simple you first plug the ubs microscope into a usb 20 port and the computer install the basic usb driver for realom window after the generic usb install be complete you install the microcapture pro for realom the cd a soon a microcapture pro be instal the usb microscope be ready to use the software which be very well think out and function quite well allow you to set different level of resolution for both capture and save in addition it can capture video something i do not try there s also the ability to add note and edit the image once it capture i do not try that feature so can not comment on it but it look a if it be a well make and think out a the rest of the program there be two way to capture an image one be to press the tiny button that come build in to the usb cable the cable also have a variable control to dim or increase the lead light level a well the other way be to press a capture button for realom within the software this be in my opinion the good way since it do not involve touch the usb cord at all which can transfer movement to the camera the program give you a choice of four format jpeg png bmp and tiff to save your image i do not know what format for video be provide since i do not capture any video i can imagine see a live bug under the microscope wow the software have other interesting feature i do not fully explore a of this review after mount this usb microscope i take some shot use the excellent software i ve attach a few of those shot in this review to show what i be able to accomplish within le than 12 hour of set up the microscope and this be without calibration if time permit i will update this review after calibration and post additional image the only con i have be with the stand which at the top have a holder for the usb cable to reduce strain seem the width of the notch be a bit too wide for the usb cable use my cable keep pop out however it easily remidie with put a bit of black tape around the usb cable at the point you want to place into the holder aside for realom that very minor issue i could not find any issue to really complain about to summarize this be a truly outstanding usb microscope package solid mechanical design well think out ergonomic and what really pull the whole thing together to make it all work be the excellent software if you need an outstanding usb microscope and can not afford a fortune or half of a fortune snap this gem up fast you will not be disappoint,Good

the unit i get be pixel perfect and work with little to no setup with my graphic card get mine straight for realom amazon warehouse i get one for realom one of the more recent batch that come in around jan 4 so maybe they have resolve whatever qc issue be go on with this monitor beautiful screen put it side by side with my vs278q which be a 27 1080p ip panel and this monitor look amazing color be a little fade in comparison but stoday i learnedl beautiful and the high resolution more than make up for it come in an enormous box i will do an update later to let anyone interested know how this unit hold up over time update 5 month later this monitor stoday i learnedl have i geeke out about how pretty and smooth it be it hold up well with 10 hour of use a day or more i have not have any more backlight bleed than i have have with any other lcd monitor and tv nor do this monitor get any hot than other lcd i own i think the reason people be notice the heat of the backlight be because of the thin bezel on this monitor i ve be read all of the concern review on this product that be here on amazon and it seem like most have response for realom asus customer support so i do not understand why people think asus be not stand behind this monitor if you have an issue with the product it be cover by a 3 year warranty need i say more asus stand fully behind their product it be an 800 monitor ok so what it be 27 and 1440p with a 144hz refor realesh rate and a gsync module not to mention it fit into a very niche market if you buy a 27 1440p panel that would cost 450 and if you buy a 27 144hz panel that will also cost around 400 then if you want either of those feature with gsync you can add another 200 to the cost of the panel this monitor be currently 750 and it include all of those feature in one package so you could argue this be a bargain it go to have the same issue every other monitor have with defect like dead pixel and possibly more due to the fact this be the first to be release with such serious hardware to manage the pixel clock necessary to keep this panel stable i love mine and everyone who see it be seriously impressed with it i would not hesitate to buy more if i have the need side note to fully utoday i learnedize this monitor i would have to recommend no le than a dual gpu computer with sli 970 at the very least i have sli 780 it is and they stoday i learnedl chug hard to feed this beast overclocke around 1150mhz i get in the low 50fps range for witcher 3 and depend on the bf4 map i get 90144fps on medium setting this monitor basically double the load on your gpu however when you be run at 1440p everything look so much clear and while medium texture may look pixelate for realom 1 foot away when you look at they for realom 5 ft or more in 1440p it pretty outstanding i have a cheap 39 4k tv cost i 340 and to put the clarity of this monitor in perspective 1440p at 27 be the same pixel density a my 4k tv so imagine 4k tv but small and insanely smooth,Good

just instal the radio this past weekend in our yamaha rhino the radio be very compact which be well suited to the small area behind the dash panel the radio connection be label and prestrippe which make my work solder much quick i can not comment on the waterproof nature of the radio yet but rest assure it will be test the only negative i have encounter thus far be that when power be remove for realom the radio and then reapplie the radio will not automatically power back on i have plan on wire the radio to the ignition switch so basically you have to press the jbl power button every time not a huge deal,Good

update after a couple of month of usage i m go to lower my rating on this radio to only 3 star ok here why first the antenna be clearly not a strong a the stock radio i have drive around in normal populated area where i should be get very strong signal i get static and signal loss also the screen glitche out every so often sometimes it load up monochromatically i ve see purple green and red and sometimes it be just electronic digital noise and you can not see anything power cycle usually fix this but it bode poorly for longevity of the product i instal this in my 2008 dodge caravan i need and buy a metra dash kit harness and antenna adapter in order to get it work and fitting well installation be not however a breeze a expect wiring to the harness and dash kit be easy except that i have a few wire leave over because of how my van harness do not have they my van do not have the option red 12v acc and light green rear cam the red wire be a problem and a i look for any wiring diagram i find that the instruction for this radio be insufficient without connect it to power i could not use the radio even though my old radio stock work with just yellow 12v i check planet audio website online and get the same booklet a be include in my box unfortunately nothing include explain the wire no diagram and since i be not a pro i have two option call tech support or try stuff untoday i learned it work first i try tech support i leave a message and more than a week go by with no response then i try stuff i cowire the red 12v with the yellow 12v together with the yellow for realom the metra harness and get power but the radio stay on unless manually power off battery drain risk i also tap into an unused red 12v in the dash for realom an accessory that my model van do not come with but i have the same issue so i finally call again and wait untoday i learned i get someone after 20 minute i get my answer and my next step which be basically call metra about the wire so i do call metra 15 minute of hold and even though they be not suppose to give instruction on this kind of thing due to liability issue the tech give i a hint to tap into a red 12v for realom an ignition power light plug i could have go all the way to the fuse panel but that seem much more work so i do the cigarette wire and now it work correctly a lot of extra work and about 35 minute of additional hold time but solve how do it look there be a small gap about two credit card wide after instal with the dash kit usually the kit fit perfectly i ask both metra and planet audio about this and both place blame on either the other company or the car since i ve use metra before and do not have this issue i believe that because that the for realont of this radio be cut in for realom the outside width there be a ledge that be le wide the because of the gap be likely the radio fault small issue but something to be aware of one thing that be a small down side be that for such a large screen it really be very plain see pic but most screen be very boring and look really basic there be no way to upgrade the gui so it be what it be how do it work the radio function really well and it really loud even with loud turn off i usually set volume to the first few click 35 and it loud enough for our van all the station come in really well bluetooth be a breeze to sync i ve sync with both android and apple phone for both call and stream sound be great on hand for realee i put the mic on the center leave of the console close to the steering wheel call be clear and people on the other line do not complain about noise streaming music control work both way phone and console and it play easily to get the picture of cd on your music you would need to use an sd card with that datum include dvd and cd work great a well and the picture be very clear it small but the resolution be sufficient to see everything crisply once installation be complete i have a very nice fully functional and inexpensive radio that work with my phone for streaming and call and have a ton of great sound option overall i m very happy with the radio but do not feel like i have enough in the instruction manual to do the right way on my own i also do not like that i call and leave a message without a return call would i recommend the radio though yes faq i have the following question that be answer by tech support after a 2 call a vm that be not return and finally 20 minute of hold time so i think i d share they in case they help you q there be a rear usb plug hardwire what be that for a it for if you want to run a usb cable for a stick device to your glove box or behind the dash and not have it stick out the for realont the for realont do have an sd card port and a micro usb plug q i do not have a parking break wire how do i remove the video block warn a wire the parking break wire to any metal to ground it that will remove the warning q what resolution be the video dvd or rear camera a 840x400 pixel it plug into a single red and white component on the rear so it can not be much high q what be the thin red and black wire hardwire to the rear of the radio a key 1 2 etc be steer wheel control i do not know this since i do not have those control q my van do not have a red 12v acc wire in my factory harness how do i make that work a the metra wiring harness come with a loose long red 12v acc wire to attach to an ignition red wire so that the radio turn off and on with the ignition wire it to another live red or cowire to the yellow constant will result in manual on and off,Average

i m always open to try out new usb cable gembonics be kind enough to provide i a sample to try out this cable be pretty much the standard cable pas around between the manufacturer and they slap their logo on it then throw it in a plastic ziplock bag there s nothing bad with that a they be not go rogue and this model cable be a solid buy nothing spectacular price be a bit high though for something like this for the 1 ft cable you re look at pay 4sh for a usb 20 that you can buy on ebay for literally 03 cent with for realee shipping although you re look at a possible 730 day delivery time compare to amazon twoday shipping if you re not in a hurry then i d go the ebay route but if you re not worried about price and need something quick you will not go wrong with this one,Good
it seem to work well but cool can be an issue if you crank the 80 mm internal fan up high the middle drive stay hot due to the poor design with no consideration for air flow between drive the drive face flat to the air parallel to fan so the first drive deflect air around 2 and 3 they should be turn perpendicular to the fan so air can flow through the drive the fan be also very loud while stoday i learnedl not do much for drive 2 and 3 i solve the cool issue by remove the back platedrive carrier and instal a 120 mm usb power low noise fan to the back of the case the case in back be just shy of a 120 mm fan width by 2 mm so it nearly a perfect fit the drive stay cool noise be much low,Good
i purchase 3 of these type of head unit different brand most have issue with iphone this do not bluetooth music call and internet work between my iphone and this headunit of corse to use internet for realom iphone to headunit you have to turn on personal hotspot overall pretty good direction do suck and also that it running android 422 and not 444 the seller claim to have an update come in the future wait for manufacturerhere what i ve find most of the app i need require 4344 or high to run so you will find yourself very limited so limited you ll start to second guess your purchase some app will say they will work on the system but will not run try load 4 different launcher none seem to work right but on 44 unit i ve see the same launcher work fine also try to change some of the icon and fail what you see be what you get at this point no know date of a 44 update unsure who really service and provide update update i ve decide to return the unit because of the software not the hardware i m scare the company will never update the software and ill be stick with 42 an outdated android operating system i recommend find a unitcompany that provide clear intention of software update and clear direction also there be no bracket in the box so i have to customize my own to mount it in the car very for realustrating so here what s important with this unit it work great yes but you must know the bluetooth signal be weak and so be wifi so you must have your phone very close to the unit at all time during music play and internet this also stress i out overall good but no amazing,Average

update that review may be a little long laughing out loud so it be a while i see the price come down that s about right i stoday i learnedl rate it a 3star after put it throw a lot of use it just to damn top heavy it like to roll over to much destroy the solar screen you will have to seat belt it down or hook it off somewhere when it not on your back other wise your go to kill the solar screen and also the top zipper be a bitch get in and out every time i d ask someone to hand i something out of the top there there 20min try to fight the zipper open and close other then that i ve make due with a full pack out at 26lbs laughing out loud i m just not that impressed do not get i wrong it a ok backpack but not really ideal for how most like to setup there bag for fish that s the short story laughing out loud now ill point out all it short coming which be y i rate it a 3 star you should be sit on the toilet for this because it go to take a while laughing out loud first the bag too easy to roll over maybe the way i pack it i highly doubt it though sec the bag lack the space for all my round shape can spray like bug spray sun screen jar power bait color dye for soft plastic reel oil think you get my point the top be about the only place it fit in but do you really want the scent leach into the lur below or your soft plastic if you have a leak or spill that would not be good for anything you have on bottem or top so i go out and buy all new spray and all the other stuff list above in a oval squirt shape bottle and in small size to fit the small side pocket and it have to be small bottle the tall bottle of spray or will not fit right and the zipper will not close all of this alone do not really make this a bad backpack nor be i say it a bad back pack just not ideal for how i like to setup for fish but i m not do yet maybe your thinking about use this bag for a fishing back pack like most people will do and for the price your go to want to take it on all fishing trip like saltwater fishing trip think again the salt spray for realom either be on a boat or just a windy day just seem to find it way in and the led light be not go to last long and the battery will corrode and fail after a while same go for the 5000mah battery maybe common sense tell you this a no brainer maybe not move on the cool factor be the solar panel that s 23watts nope try 23watts it will take 2 too 3 day to charge the battery pack that s if your in good sun that be battery pack charger it be not it a battery maintainer you would be dead of old age if your wanting to use this panel to charge the battery pack 40 buck for a 23watt solar panel you can get a 15 watt panel for under 50 buck and it not that comfortable to carry on your back all day but again maybe it just all in how you pack it and how much you carry in it again it not a bad bag just not really worth the price tag i think for the cool factor that your go to upgrade if you plan to keep this bag for charge your toy a large 13000mah battery pack or large would have be a lot well and prob a large solar panel if i have to buy it all over again i would not i d just get something else with more room and space you can always add all the cool factor stuff to another bag if that s what your after p if you buy just the bag without the tray and solar panel it cheap and most all lure tray fit in this bag chance be your tray will fit mine do plus the tray be not much to be desire there lay out be not to my liking they lack in space for large lur at the bottom and if your look for anything in my review that address the quality of the bag it not the good but not the bad stitching be hold up zip be ok it hard to zip around the gear on the outside due to there placement and like i say before it roll over easy i feel it due to it for realame the bottem base could be large that would really help with it be tipsy and would have give we room for our can spray oh and i do not like that they do not make a hole throw the bag to route the solar panel power wire it just run throw the zip in the door and there s no hole route for the wire to charge your phone also so your phone willnt rest inside the pocket the wire hold the phone halfway out of the pocket think i can fix that though also the rain fly only cover the for realont of the bag not the back guess it well then nothing and in closing would have be nice if they would have add some small bottomless velcro latch outside pocket for pocket knife leatherman tool stuff you do not want to have to dig in the zipper pocket for but they do not add a one not on the inside nor out oh well i ve learn to make due with it,Average

recognize brand for memory and other electronic device if you do not know already they be an electronics manufacturer seem to be a good quality build i actually do not think the quality would be a good a it be i open the box and though wow this be nicely package and everything seem solid i like the braid cord on the headphone a well see screenshot for package very comfortable and fit around my ear i actually buy these because for some reason every time i plug headphone with the 35 mm standard jack into my alienware laptop i have to reinstall the audio driver and then when i unplug they i have to reinstall the driver again for the speaker to start work do not have this problem with the usb headphone plug these in sound work unplugged speaker work again fit my need,Good
i can only give this 4 star because the device have issue supply power to more then one device plug into it at any one time their be port and i should be able to charge a device on all 4 at the same time but it seem to only send power to the first device in sequence that be actively turn on each port have a button to control which port be turn on and off and that function seem to work well enough but you plug a phone into the first port and phone into the second port with both port turn on only the first phone will receive a charge maybe this be just a flaw in my product or maybe this be intentional by design and i over look this in the product description it work great guy that be just the functional flaw i think i should share with you i do love that this device be small and flat on one side which allow i to use velcor to secure to the side of my computer desk i do need to work on cable management a you can tell for realom the photo with the thumb tack hold it in place,Good
excellent perform flash drive 16 gb be ample for the basic a you probably can tell this thing be absolutely tiny depend on where you be use this it can be a good or bad thing in some case a large physical size drive be well so you can actually get a hold on it and remove it like the for realont of my xbox 360 or behind my tv for i this be perfect for a car stereo a it tiny and low profile though i would definitely recommend use a lanyard of some sort because it just that small i inithanks in advancelly attach a small ring and some string but end up use an old flashlight lanyard look much clean and it long enough i will not be a likely to lose it though i would not pull it by the lanyard it look too for realagile for that great choice when you need something small,Good

i love braid cable it just make they so much strong than most of the thin charging cable i have i really like this cable in particular it a nice color and i m a fan of colored cable too since it make it easy to tell apart for realom other cable that be plug in around it the cable work really well i plug it into my computer at work and my iphone 6 and it plug in easily to both and start charge right away with no error message the cable seem really sturdy like i would have to try hard to break it which be great it be also very long honestly it be more length than i need at work so i bring it back home but it will be really nice to have when i need to charge my phone but do not want to be stick next to an outlet overall i think this be a great useful cable my husband seem jealous of my new cable i may just have to get another one for he disclaimer i receive this product at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion,Good

the illumination be awesome it not the randomly place leak backlighte you see on other keyboard that shine in between and up through the key it exactly and only on the lettering on each key i only ever use the red color the other be too strong for my taste i do wish it have a memory setting to keep it on that color because i have to cycle back to red for every power on i also like how when i lean back or back up my chair to watch a movie the angle of the lighting fade out somewhat this mean that when i m up close for gaming or work the letter be brightly light but when i want to relax and watch a video it fade out and i do not notice it also i can not understate the awesomeness of the hotbar key without any programming whatsoever they have integrate with all of my software exactly how i want they to they control my email client my video volume calculator etc i wish the keyboard have a big soft wrist rest but i use a separate one now also the key be not ideal for type a they sometimes catch on themselves or require too much force to push but honestly i just get this for the amazing illumination even though the switch and tactoday i learnede feeling be not perfect it stoday i learnedl work just fine for league of legend i mean unless you re write a book or go to be write daily i do not think it an issue if you be go to do that get another keyboard update 12 jul 2013 you can not change this to dvorak layout without modify the f j h and you key they do not fit in the slot they need to because they be different see my photo and note in the photo section,Good

updated review i inithanks in advancelly rate this a 5star product but change my review to a 3star due to the construction of the hub after have this a few day i notice the casing be come apart i check this out and find the two plastic piece be not really hold together by anything i be able to fix this by add a small drop of super glue onto each peg before put it back together it really be not that big an issue but consider the product be brand new i do not expect to have to fix the casing aside for realom that it be a great product thus far and i d stoday i learnedl reorder it if i need another usb hub,Average
i be use this drive after format it for use on window 7 sp1 i get it on clearance i have use it a handful of time in the past month of ownership for manual drag and drop copying and it have be work fine so far i do not use wdsmartware it be use a a simple external hard drive positive 1 relatively quiet operation i can hear the click but it not disturbingly loud i have it locate next to my laptop 2 stoday i learnedl work without problem so far after a month 3 not a heavy a i think it would be 4 do not have a ac brick but see negative tradeoff below 5 the drive power off when the computer shut down when use window 7 6 it have a power button to turn it on instead of auto on when it be plug into the wall outlet negative 1 case material be thin and can easily scratch definitely a cheap build 2 just touch the usb cord on the connection point to the hard drive will cause the computer to recognize that it have be disconnect for realom it so do not move the drive when it connect to the computer or risk lose data 3 the plug to the wall outlet be bulky about 3 inch tall and a couple of inch wide but at least it be light weight especially compare to the old style ac brick,Average
i have be in the usb business for almost 10 year we always test the work of factory before we buy mass quantity for use in industrial processing i get a chance to be a mystery shopper when a factory sell on amazon i can test their product without they know there be no well way to get a true sense of their quality then by test their normal average everyday output no way for they to send i cherry pick product i try the product for realom this supplier and be very impressed at their quality i can recommend they without reservation and that be rare in this business here be what i find 1 the product came professionally package i sometimes receive drive stuff in polybag a if someone just take a handful and ship they to i not this time this create a great first impression of course the real measure be in the product quality which i describe next 2 they use smi controller which be the premium controller it cost a bit more but perform reliably and be worth the extra cost most factory will use lowergrade controller like alcor or chipsbank the cost saving with the other controller be not worth the stability risk 3 they use a brand name memory in this case it be hynix it not so much the brand per se but it that they be use identifiable memory most of the lowcost seller on amazon other online site use generic bulk memory to save money 4 they use premium grade memory not the promograde memory prefer by lowcost seller the premium grade aka gooddie be know for stability and high readwrite speed quite for realankly i do not often see such high grade memory use in these kind of sale and i be quite impressed the promograde memory be often downgrade memory that can not pas at high capacity a 8 gb drive for example often use 16 gb memory that can not pas testing at that capacity the factory will then program the controller chip to downgrade it to 8 gb not this factory they use highgrade for realom the start for our testing method we use a dedicated 35000 machine for realom imi to conduct readwrite test we test for speed we then burnin the drive by write test pattern and read they back for comparison the promograde memory will typically see a lot failure rate of 17 or more my test lot for realom this supplier show zero failure after a 100 test the readwrite speed test be quite impressive a show here the real capacity be show in byte and the speed be show in mb these be the individual result for realom the 10pack i purchase the review do not allow for table so i include a screen capture test testdate testing realbytes read write 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24535 8813 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24595 8487 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24647 8560 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24635 8412 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24569 8801 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24590 8724 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24684 8890 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24632 8982 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24605 9732 7243 192016 pas 8053063680 24673 8791 these be very good result and these be very high quality drive i welcome question,Good

i present to you lord vader that s his nickname i be in a photowalk group and notice that several of the member own this lens most have purchase it for the value and quality of the image when we compare our photo i notice that they be able to get great shot straight out of the camera whereas i have to crop or zoom in order to show the detail of my wildlife image i be beyond excited with this lens it a little heavy than the average zoom but it worth it weight when you see what you can do it reasonably fast in bright light and the bokeh be gorgeous at each stop the picture that i ve share be take at the alligator farm and the catty shack in florida they have not be crop the tiger be shoot through a fence at manual focus while the other be set to automatic on a canon 6d in the past my alligator look like twig in the water now it look a if i swim amongst they i choose this particular package a it have additional accessory the backpack hold this lens along with a few other it have a slot for a luggage carttrolly which make it much easer to carry if you be plan on a long day of shoot you can never have enough sd card and the filter be helpful for certain lighting condition such a the summer sky the monopod be useful but if you need a truly steady hand nothing beat a tripod if you need a fast lens for low light or action shot there be sport version of the sigma 150600 for the wildlife photographer take daylight photo it perfect,Good

the trendnet tbw106ub class 1 usb bluetooth adapter be a diminutive usb adapter that bring bluetooth function to computer that lack bluetooth functionality or suffer for realom brokenunreliable bluetooth hardware it worth note that this review be for version 20r which be make available in 2014 the now discontinue version 10r that go by the same tbw106b name be release 2005 and only support bluetooth 21 it somewhat unfortunate that the amazon product page mix review for both model since bluetooth support in modern operating system have vastly improve over the year and the experience be now pretty seamless compare to even 3 year ago besides physical size the key feature of the trendnet tbw106ub be it class 1 designation up to 100 meter range support for bluetooth 40 le and inclusion of bluesoleil 924722 software back in the day when operating system like window xp do not offer native bluetooth support it be software like bluesoleil that make thing work today if you re use a modern operating system like window 810 or a mac for realom the last 5 year unless you have a specific reason and you know who you be the operate system inbox bluetooth driver be go to be good enough with respect to the 100 m claim keep in mind that this only work with other class 1 device most bluetooth headset be class 2 for example which mean they re only good for up to 10 m you might be able to eke some long range out of say a bluetooth speaker system since the traffic be largely oneway but do not expect the device to pair for realom a distance for this review i instal this bluetooth adapter on a window 10 desktop that i build and i rely only on windows builtin bluetooth driver overall the experience be painlesswindow immediately detect the adapter and instal the appropriate software use the setting app i go to device bluetooth and be immediately able to search for bluetooth device within a few minute i successfully and simultaneously pair a bluetooth keyboardmouse and headset to test slightly more advanced bluetooth functionality i pair my samsung note 5 and try send and receive a few file by rightclicke on the bluetooth icon in the system tray and select send a file i be able to send document and picture to my phone by select receive a file and inithanks in advancete a share via bluetooth for realom my phone i be able to send a video though the transfer rate be slow bluetooth with edr top out at 3mbps which be slow than even usb 11 which be rate at 12mbps usb 20 rate at 480mbps be over 150x fast overall this bluetooth adapter have meet my performance and functionality expectation i would be leery of leave it attach to a laptop while i move it around because this adapter do not seem particularly durable but that s not an issue with my desktop,Good
update review after use these for almost a year i have have 2 out of 5 fail and become unusable i have not have this problem with other flash drive i recommend get a brand name so you do not have this problem,Bad
for year i have be use an extension cord and 3 different wall charger plug in to the end of it next to my night stand finally i find a five port desktop charger you ve probably see 5 port charger before there s dozen of they on amazon but what make this one different be that it have a stand to put your phone in not very useful to i because of my case to save space on your desk and two ac outlet that be spread apart enough to fit 2 small adapter or 1 large adapter and one small cord the outlet be very tight though so you will need to put a hand on it to pull the plug out i think i be go to be disappoint in the usb charger i do not like to have different amperage on different port i like they all to be the same so when i get this and see the 3 port label 1 amp and 2 label 24 amp i be not happy however i recently buy a usb power meter to see how much power my ipad use apparently the include apple lightning cable can not even give it 24 amp i have to use a well one so here how i test my charger i only do it when the ipad battery be low below 30 because otherwise it will not take a much power then i play a youtube video full screen at 1080p 60fps at full brightness this be the most power the ipad can possibly use i plug in to the 1 amp port expect to get 98 amp or like the other reviewer say 11 amp but i be get 235 amazing i then move it to the next port and get the same thing turn out the label only represent the max output of the whole thing not the individual port all the port be the same pro perfect travel charger and everyday long enough cord for my night stand 2 ac outlet phone stand to save space on desk 24 amp charge con not ul list certify but very high quality so that do not bother i phone stand might be useless to people that do not have really thin phone or have case in conclusion i be very satisfied with this product while i do receive it for for realee to review if i be not able to i definitely would have purchase it myself i be not ask to leave a positive review i could have just keep but i feel it really deserve it update september 2016 i ve be use this every night for a year now and it stoday i learnedl work like a charm i hope it last forever ill be back next year to update this review again,Good

i buy this item for realom a store but since the product id match i do not see how it could be different this be my first fore into usb 30 and i have to say i m a little upset although my motherboard have usb 30 port and window 7 x64 sp1 support say usb 30 it do not so after a few day of try everything i almost have a break through i get the usb 30 work for about 12 minute then the driver crash i m guess usb 30 be probably well leave to addin card for now while the usb 30 be work i only get 28mbs out of it usb 20 max at 1618mbs when this drive not the enclosure be hook to esata it run at 55mbs so i know it be not the drive ill chuck it up to the usb 30 port on the motherboard my mother board be a msi 870ag54 just a warning to those who own it the nec driver do not work correctly in either window 7 x64 sp1 or window xp x64 sp2 with that say the usb 20 work fine something that the description and box do not mention be the need for two usb port on the system one port be for datum the other be for power at least that s what i presume i ve manage to get usb 20 run without the second usb plug but the drive make an underpowered sound after a few second this be a let down since other usb 20 enclosure only need one cable technically a usb 30 device should not need two plug either since more power come for realom the port by standard the instruction make no note about this it leave up to experimentation the case be hard aluminum and feel firm one point regard the usb cable it use a full size usb plug so even when run the drive in usb 20 mode the user will need a usb 30 cable i give this device a 4 out of five star it a decent device though untoday i learned usb 30 get fully standardized i suggest a usb 20 or esatausb 20 enclosure esata be a proven technology along with usb 20 laptop have addon card that add esata port and most laptop have all usb 20 port in the future this may be a great product but for now i d say pas on this for something that will work no matter what,Good

so this product and all the other like it that strap around your ipads cover look good but once you strap it around your smart cover you will quickly realize you have a major problem the cover will not fold back and lie flat on your ipad because this thing be not a huge obstruction that get in the way it make the ipad hard to hold securely you can not lay it flat on any surface because it rock all over the place it just a bad combination i do not have a problem with the construction or quality of the product just the general concept it not functional i quickly ditch this concept and go with a simple adhesive pen loop they be cheap hold the pencil in place fain real lifey well and do not interfere with my cover i think the pen loop along with maybe a silicon pencil cover would be a perfect combination see my attached photo and decide for yourself,Bad
this review be for the rocketek 3way usb microusb microsd adapter model rtotgm this little whippersnapper be fast i just test it use nirsofts for realeeware speed testing app usbdeview after insert a sandisk extreme plus 32 gb microsd card and it read speed be 001 mb fast than my sandisk extreme the rocketek reach 1659 mb and the sandisk extreme reach 1658 mb the write speed 1639 be 176 mb slow than the sandisk extreme 1815 note that i run these test on a late 2011 macbook pro so my definition of fast be not the same a it be for someone use modern hardware with usb 30 port with a sandisk extreme microsd card insert usbdeview identify this rocketek device a vendor name super top vid 14cd pid 8170 in general super top devices speed test result be not that good certainly not in the upper tier so i m pleasantly surprised to see this particular device have relatively good result oddly i seem to have be the first one to test this particular super top device on nirsofts publish result test page a of 7 jun 2017 most usb device include other super top adapter have dozen or even hundred of other test result for comparison if you purchase this particular device and have a computer with usb 30 port please test your device and publish the result on nirsofts usb speed test website i would imagine this device real world speed with currentday hardware would be high than my post speed you need to insert a microsd card to run the nirsoft usbdeview speed test because usbdeview require a drive letter to run the read and write operation note that unlike with this adapter some other manufacturer adapter stoday i learnedl will not work with nirsoft usbdeview even after you insert a microsd card and window assign a drive letter the device come with a white and a black rubber holder that you can squeeze the device into but i discard both of they instead i use a little black canvas zipper pouch about the size of a pack of trident chew gum that you can purchase at for realys electronics to store your sd and microsd card and usb stick the device be tiny enough that it be probably at more risk of be lose than of be damage figure out how to insert the microsd card be a little awkward at first but easy for realom that point forward what you do be turn the device upsidedown so that the rocketek name be face away for realom you insert the microsd card in what be now the upper slot with the microsds label face you and it pin face the bottom surface of the upper slot the slot be key so if you insert it wrong you will feel that it will not go in my only concern so far which may or may not be justify be the internal circuitry vendor name super top this be the same internal vendor name a a horrible datadestroye digipower multi card reader model dpmcr4 that i purchase at walmart however so far i have not see any datum corruption issue instability or spontaneous file copy for realeezeup with the rocketek device perhaps there be nothing wrong with super top but rather with digipowers implementation of super top chipset and possibly relate to nirsofts inablity to run a speed test even with a drive letter assign to the digipower device i will update this post if i find any problem with the rocketek rtotgm,Good
i have high hope for this charger but it do not work with my nokia n8 it do work with the jabra extreme bluetooth headset gnmbt530 when i plug a usb cable into the charger and into the phone the battery charge indicator on the phone do not start move and a small led next to the usb port do not light up indicate that the battery be not charge i unplug the usb cable for realom the charger and plug it into the pc and the phone start charge which prove that the problem be with the charger i presume the output current of this charger 5v dc 2100ma be outside of the acceptable range for my nokia n8 phone unfortunately if i can not charge my phone use this charger it be useless for i on the plus side it be small attractively style and seemingly well build this be a world charger wich accept ac 100210v input the electical plug prong fold into the charger when not use and make it very compact for storage and travel i be guess that the glossy surface will get scratch and scuff pretty quickly,Average

this be for the k70 lux rgb with brown switch pro 1 come with a removable wrist rest that today i learnedt depend on the incline of the keyboard it very easy to snap on and off 2 have foot on both the for realont and the back so you can today i learnedt the keyboard up down or raise the whole thing up a little 3 you can assign each key a different light there be also a button to cycle the light through low medium high and off 4 have a button to lock the window key which be useful for gaming 5 dedicated medium key volume control be a wheel and there be a mute key you do not have to push function to use they 6 key be raise or rather there s nothing cover they some people might not like the look of this but i actually think it look well in person than it do in photo 7 key be removable and it come with the tool to do so combine with the raise key it very easy to clean this keyboard 8 come with a couple of extra key that be grey textured and have an exaggerated slope on they you can see the wasd key i replace in my photo 9 the cord be suuuuuuper thick i have a photo of the cord next to a normal plastic coat cord to show the difference 10 come with a usb slot on the back 11 it sturdy the top be some sort of metal con 1 wrist guard be texture with tiny circle indent i spill some food on it and i stoday i learnedl can not clean it completely it a sort of soft rubbery plastic if that make sense which be nice but it also get smudge on it that be hard to get off 2 only one usp port in the back i really want a headphone socket since the one on my computer case be mess up however i be able to just buy an adapter to plug into the keyboard easy to reach than my case but it do sort of ruin the profile of the keyboard to have that stick out 3 the stop fast forward reverse etc key be above the number pad because the regular key be raise so high it can be a little awkward try to reach they i personally do not use they often so it not a big deal 4 it take up two usb slot on your computer kind of cancel out the fact that it have one build in 5 a someone who have never own a keyboard like this before it be not completely obvious to i at first how to change the light on the key you have to go to the corsair website to download the software first and the software be a little confusing but i eventually figure it out if anything the bad part be try to be decisive about what color you want to use other note 1 the light flow out for realom underneath the key i like my old logitech keyboard where only the letter on the key light up but this style seem pretty common to most backlit keyboard i ve see it a little flashy than i need it to be but it not a glare in person a it look online and some people might prefer it this way 2 it definitely louder than your normal office keyboard but not nearly a bad a most mechanical keyboard i ve hear with my headphone on it not an issue but i share a space with someone else some people might love the sound of it but other might find it annoying i adapt to it pretty quickly personally my con be pretty minor my only real complaint be the amazon product page i m stoday i learnedl not completely sure what the difference be between each of the keyboard but i love the one i get,Good

when my wife express interest in a computer for run vms i buy an i76700 and place it into an exist mini itx slimline build when she mention want a single pc that could do everything for she include game it be pretty obvious that the halfwidth gtx 750 ti in my slimline build would not cover it and she need a fullbuild pc of her own center around that 6700 with room for more and more powerful component than my slimline could provide the problem i keep run into with choose a motherboard be that her cpu be an i76700 it not z170 material but h110 m board do not have the feature i want or for realankly enough power phase for i to be comfortable strap even a nonk 6700 to they b150 make sense a a possible chipset and come across this board make it a sure thing for i no question if you re run any skylake cpu aside for realom the 6600 k and 6700 k this board be a great value the board be a joy to build on plenty of clearance plenty of expansion slot and perhaps the easy time i ve ever have get a motherboard to line up with the io backplate there be a couple of tab that have to be physically remove for realom the backplate to get everything to fit but nothing major the board have a bit more flex to it than i m entirely comfortable with but i be never concern enough to stop and rethink thing i do not know if this be intentional on msis part but the placement of the second cpu fan header be perfect for water cool in fact there be enough clearance all around that the 240 mm radiator earmark for this build fit in without any block connection the board also boast an m2 connection and more fan header than any b150 chipset board should reasonably need so no worry about case cool the motherboard come with a cd a all motherboard do full of driver and software definitely install the chipset driver the softwareeh i generally just grab any software i want right for realom the oems website it guarantee to be up to date while you re there check and make sure your bios be up to date a well a for aesthetic the overall brown color scheme certainly be not the most beautiful thing i ve ever lay eye upon but in a subdued case layout without led ram or over the top lighting it work fine i d consider it to be utoday i learneditarian no one go to mistake it for a sabertooth but that s ok because if you ve get an 80 sabertooth it probably do not work if bright flashy build be your thing look elsewhere and i think that s where ill leave this one it perfect for my need absolutely perfect because i have a locked cpu and basically just need a functional board that i could throw my spare part at to make my wife a pc good feature and a solid oem behind it be a huge plus and at this price point there be just no reason not to pick up this board and give it a try so far it working like a champ and ill definitely keep this board in mind if my slimline itx workstation ever need to grow up into a midtower,Good

i have many of the 2 tb drive of all type like 8 of they they be fast reach 200 mb on read and 150 mb on write the old 2 tb model have the slow rpm and they stoday i learnedl get to 150mb110 mb speed the 3 tb drive be base on the 2 tb 7200rpm drive and they use to be slightly fast than the 2 tb drive but the new 3 tb drive serial num w1fxxxxx use sc4x firmware model number have be change for realom 9yn166 to 1e6166 a well and do not have ncq ncq help speed up buffer flush so the drive do not have to finish command and keep move the head back to write the mft before and after each file copy you can sort of fix this by disable write buffer flush in window the new drive stoday i learnedl read fast at upto 200 mb speed file copy start at over 150mbsec but write to the drive soon drop down to 40mbsec or le i be really shocked since that s almost the speed of usb2 and file copy between my old 2 tb drive never drop under 100 mb and even the old 15 tb drive move file at 8090mbsec the transfer start at 150mbsec but steadily drop untoday i learned it hit like 40mbsec this could be use the new seagate write technology to pack in more bitsinch where adjacent track have to also be rewrite so they have to read those into the buffer first but i do not know those drive be out yet i could find no info on the new firmware they be not on any website my main drive be an ssd so i can copy file at max speed to it but copy for realom it get slow down after like 10 gb or so i even hook up my 2 tb drive via usb3 and my 15 tb drive and file copying between they move along at over 80 mb the old 160 gb sata1 copy at 45 mb which be fast than the 3 tb drive which be correct since the 15 tb drive be a 5 year old model and the 160 gb be a decade old model but even across a usb3 bus i be stoday i learnedl get over 80 mb on these old drive and i only get under 40 mb on the brand new drive i do not know exactly what the problem be since i can copy 5 gb of file at 150mbsec it be only when i go to move large amount that it slow down the 2 tb never slow down like this it do get slow a the inside track get use but the 3 tb be not even half full another thing i notice be that with hdtune the graph be not smooth it vary between 150mb200 mb for realom start to finish end at 150mb100 mb at the end while on all the other drive the graph stick pretty close to 5mb instead of the 50 mb change here so not only do it not have ncq it be also slow down drastically when you be try to backup 1 tb of datum do it at over 100 mb be vastly different than do it at 40 mb maybe it the new technology since i see review of the old 3 tb drive and they be not do this just make sure you do not get the w1fxxxxx drive not have ncq be a major disappointment since it slow down drastically when move a large number of small file and almost become unusable with window write flush enable the w1fxxxx letter mean s su suzhou china w wu wuxi china z tk korat thailand teparuk plant in thailand f 3 platter with either 5 or 6 head while e 2 platter d e and f appear to designate 2 4 and 6 head z1 drive have datum density of 1 tb per platter while the z2 drive have 500 gb platter the z be where it be manufacture warning please note this 3 tb drive get hot the drive be rate upto 60c but they fail quick the hot it get my 2 tb rarely get to 50c and usually run at 40c but place it on a flat desk and move file it get to 59c before i power it off since at over 60c it trigger a smart attribute change that be with a ceiling fan run over the case i be not exactly sure where the trigger get pull for warranty purpose but my 15 tb drive have hit over 70c often and that fail after le than 3000 or so hour these be the only 2 drive i see that get over 50c in decade the old 500 mb 05 gb maxtor drive would get this hot this be a very bad case the hole at the bottom be useless to get rid of the heat and i have to place it on the side to make it run cooler around 50c since the regular external be place on it end and not flat like the expansion it do not matter which direction the drive be at which be stoday i learnedl 10c hot than run the bare drive inside the computer case the plastic black case do not feel hot so you have to use a program that pull the smart value to show you airflow temperature these drive can cause significant datum loss in power loss situation because of the way the track be write it be not just the datum that be be write that be lose during a power failure but also datum in adjacent track and entire file if a small text file that be getting update during a power failure datum in other file will also get corruptedlost after use these drive for a month i give it a 1 star and not recommend for any use include backup pay the 5 buck extra and get the regular drive without staggered track,Average
the upside be that for my macbook pro 13 late 2013 on macos 1012 it work just fine no driver truly plug and play i have my macbook on a 100mbps switch so it limit the 180mbps that i get for realom my cable provider i be get 9234mbps down and 537mbps up this be slightly bad than my accell usb to ethernet adapter which you have to install the driver for a it get 9981mbps down and 517mbps up so almost the same but for 999 this will do just fine i take a star away a it be not quite a good a my accell adapter but the cablecreation adapter will go into my travel bag by the way the ping latency difference be likely a speedtest select different server but the latency should not have much of an affect on the updown speed just not great if you be game and need a fast response ie low network latency or voip phone call for that matter,Good

product work a promise and it solid black like i need easy to install and sturdy on thing i want to comment on be the comment about the protect green light i ve read comment for realom it make a good night light to it be overbare in area you do not want light i do rely on the customer comment but sometimes i have to sit back and laugh for example one time i purchase a reputable portable air compressor for realom here some individual be complain of it be too loud it an air compressor what do you expect jeesh i actually almost do not buy this surge protector because of some of the overexaggerate about the light i be glad i do not pay attention and follow my gut instinct picture be worth a 1000 word so here they be the little green light be at the bottom of each picture hardly bright enough to see your own hand 2 inch in for realont of your face,Good
so be you need both a headphone and microphone jack on your laptop well this might be the product for you but if you have a macbook you might want to take a look at something else because if you use it with a macbook you would not be able to use any of the other port that be leave or right for realom the usb port you decide to plug the adapter in i have a 2012 model and once you plug the adapter in it cover part of the sd card slot and the other usb port or the thunderbolt port this be also the case for other laptop if you have 2 usb port right next to each other other than that the adapter be build with aluminum and it make the adapter look really professionally make but it a little of a disappointment if you really need an adapter like this but it to big and it cover you other port up if trond maybe put both of the headphone and microphone jack close together on the device it might not cover up other port one way trond could fix this problem be include a small usb extension cord overall if you need an adapter and do not need to use it a lot then it great but since it cover up other port that you might need you might want to look for something a little bit small i be provide with this item at a discount price for testing and my fair and honest evaluation,Good
take a couple hour to get the overclock to work right at 100hz guess the panel need to get break in since then it glorious perfect with my setup and absolute maxed setting,Good
very nice case solid fit and finish probably nice than the price might suggest thank you china the only minus be the fan be a bit loud i try to disconnect the fan which be easy enough once you get past the bridge card and the power supply just a few screw but unplug the fan seem to trigger some sort of protection circuit where the drive will not power up and the blue light will continuously blink plug the fan back in everything back to normal i suppose you could probably wire a resistor in place of the fan to fake out the circuit but it not worth the hassle a for mac user i could not get my 2012 mbp retina wmavericks to see the drive by plug in directly however plug it into a usb hub on my dell monitor allow it to appear but probably only a a usb2 device i ve have this issue with other drive enclosure i m not worried though since i m just rip my cd collection and do not need the bandwidth wasus 24x dvdrw serialata internal oem drw24b1st edit my 2013 mbair do recognize the drive wosx 1085,Good

my old asus router i ve have for year need an upgrade and try to cheap out on a nonbrand router but of course it fail so spend the extra for the asus and could not be happy the setup be very simple anyone can do this by follow the instruction sheet you do not even have to change the ssid name of the wifi access point you usually select anywhere or customize it with your own and create a password once that s do you re set the router be secure and you re ready to start surf currently we have up to 200 mbps download speed package with our local isp the last router we have for realom wise tiger do not even reach it full speed even next to the router with the asus rtacrh13 the wifi speed jump across the 200 mbps barrier during the evening at full speed usually i see a significant drop with the 24 ghz try to surf with the tablet or the phone in my bedroom but both for realequency do really well consider there be number of wall in between the screenshot show the speed i be get at both 24 5 ghz next to the router and at the far end of the bedroom the router be setup on the second floor we be on a three level condo in the living so center in the building with all four antenna straight up a show in the product photo reading use my cell phone 5 ghz at the router 235 mbps down 12 mbps up 5 ghz upstairs 156 mbps down 12 mbps up 24 ghz at the router 97 mbps down 12 mbps up 24 ghz upstairs 63 mbps down 12 mbps up i love that it have usb 3 port and for what we do since we do not do online gaming but your usual netflix and 56 device connect surf the speed be more than adequate my old asus router last more than five year and stoday i learnedl go strong so hope this router will last just a long it a bargain consider how much fast this router be a far a the wifi coverage our condo be roughly 1400 sqft total in three level with the asus router on the second floor while i can not say for sure how far the signal would reach in traditional home i can see it be more than adequate for up to 2000 sqft home for the price i would not hesitate to buy another unit to have consistently strong signal since be move to a twostory house with a basement soon i have a great feeling this router will provide enough coverage throughout our new house,Good

this be the bad purchase i have make on amazon in year i think that be a tplink it would be good quality product but should have take into account all the 1star and negative review on amazon and also around the web at first the router never turn on and also the 5 indicator led be never light a they should then after leave it connect for more than 2 hour light by itself but with all the 5 green indicator light always on include the reset led i also try with 8 different power adapter and four cable just in case the original adapter have problem but it do not work nothing work no wireless no lan cable no internet connection no reset nothing this router be totally for realozen and do no work at all now after 3 day of unsuccessful testing the router only show the reset green light totally fix and if you hold this reset button for more than 10 second to reset the router it do nothing so the router be useless because be completely block and for realeezed please see the photo i must say that i have large knowledge and experience with computer networking but i have never come across with a product of such poor quality a this tplink router i m so disappointed and upset with this product that i do not want that amazon send i back a replacement product but i will contact amazon just to let they to know all the problem that i have experience with this poor quality product a other have already state in their1star review do not buy this product because it really have serious problem and be not a reliable routernor have the quality of other tplink product,Bad
i order this on aug 2015 i only start to use it on dec 2015 finally in le than 10 month it stop work the error be write protect error i get this error yesterday and i already have do enough research for this issue find the drive come with fat32 format to avoid problem you need to format it a ntfs or other new file system before use it do not leave it a fat32 error description when you copy a huge file or a file with a long name the drive be in fat32 may get an error also in combination with overheat issue in my case i try to copy 2 g of file with some file have long name while the drive be hot overheating by itself the last thing i see before the write protect error be a dialog box the filename you copy need to truncate because of the length skip or ok the drive response to this error be to shut itself in write protect mode to prevent a crash for user it mean they can stoday i learnedl access the content but no more update they can not delete or create anymore none of the hard drive tool would be able to undo the write protect mode you will not be able to format or delete a a result the user can only return this drive to the manufacturer yet there be a problem since there be no more update allow the user would return this drive with all datum intact and accessible by other do you want to gamble your privacy when your personal datum be in the drive it mean you probably will not return it and accept the loss,Bad
super value in a mechanical keyboard i love this thing,Good

be use this panel for over a month now and wait to write my review to make sure there be no issue with it if you ve read some of the review with people post about fail panel inversion issue blurry text and all that it might scare you off for realom purchase it believe i i be one of those that be on the fence because i do not want to throw down close to 800 and end up with something that fail on i in a few week time or have issue like inversion well since i ve have it for one month now i can say the panel have behave quite well there s no dead pixel no detectable inversion the inversion issue be overblown gsync work a advertise and be buttery smooth my only concern be that the monitor run very hot if you touch the bottom right corner of it while it on you can feel the heat through the plastic and it hot to the touch with some people have unit that fail after a couple month it always in the back of my mind that i could be next now a far a the panel itself be concern because it an 8 bit tn panel the color be a lot well than your standard variety tn panel in fact the srgb gamut match most ip display the big problem i have with this panel be the ag coating i wish asus would have stick with semi glossy or even glossy this be a gaming monitor first and foremost not an office computer so we really do not need ag coat with this thing in addition be a tn panel you will see a lot of color shifting if you move your head rightleftupdown and unfortunately there s not much you can do about that due to the nature of the technology but when it come to gaming if you have a computer that can support it 144 hz gsync in game be a surreal experience i have an lg 27ea83d 10 bit ip panel next to this that operate at 60 hz and even have a decent response time but it be night and day between the two in game my kd ratio go up dramatically in game like bf4 after get this monitor and there s absolutely no way i could ever go back to a panel that be not 144 hz or lack gsync support also i ve read a lot of horror story of asus rma service so that also have i worried should i run into problem with this otherwise fantastic panel the price could also be well for this display but with it be such a niche product you kind of expect a high cost associate with it amd have a compete for realeesync solution come first panel arrive in marchapril but that s stoday i learnedl an unproven technology so who know how it will stack up against gsync in performance or cost if you re think of get this monitor go for it you will not regret it edit just want to update and add that one year later the monitor be stoday i learnedl go strong with no issue it be no long the good on the market a asus have an ip one that be arguably a well purchase but overall i m very happy with this purchase and have no regret,Good
this unit start out great fast speed for about 2 month i be get 90100mb now the speed be really slow for a usb3 hub and it be often below 40mb transfer speed and average in the 20s30mbs range this be a really disappointing buy,Bad

vantec be not the most wellknown company but they make some very good hard drive enclosure and this be no exception the enclosure itself be one solid piece of aluminum with two end plastic piece one of which be attach to the hardware and plug into your hard drive the aluminum do a great job of dissipate heat and rarely feel hot to the touch even during heavy use there s no onoff button on the drive and there be one single blue led that flicker to indicate drive activity there s a jack for an ac adapter but it do not come with one instead they package a ysplitter usb cable so you can draw additional power for realom a second usb port if need on the opposite end of the drive be a thin mirror detail that add a bit of pointless but not unappreciated shiny the packaging be also very nice and compact installingremove a hard drive be a snap all of the circuitry be attach to one of the plastic end piece and that snap right into the hard drive just match up the pin and go then just slide that right into the enclosure and close it up with the two include tiny screw there be nothing else secure the hard drive to the enclosure so it do jiggle around inside you can tape a few piece of paper to the metal side of the hard drive to fix the jiggle a complaint i ve hear in other review about this drive be that the place where the screw go be not properly thread and the screw be easy to strip i have no problem put the screw in i screw both in at the same time tighten one a bit then switch to the other switch back to the first and so forth also do not overtighten the screw they do indeed seem easy to strip i m use mine with my mac a a backup drive and a time machine drive the o first claim the drive be unreadable but it just need to be format correctly hf for mac also it run fine off of one usb port on my macbook pro and i d assume for all recent mac and of course it work on window though my pc do not know what to do with my macformatted hard drive anyway if you ve get an sata laptop drive in need of a case this be a great choice it cheap and small than the other vantec sata drive and it work like a charm the only thing that make i mark it down for realom a 5star rating be the slight jiggle of the hard drive kind of annoying to craft your own fix for it,Good
i can not say enough about this outlet station i will be purchase another one or few take up little space and perfect for counter top desk or shelf you can shut off outlet and usb when item not in use there be three different power button 2 for outlet and one for usb i receive this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review,Good
i ve get this along with a couple of 4 tb wd black drive to use a raid1 external storage for multimedia file and backup today i have receive all of these instal the drive into this enclosure and try it out while i generally like the end result the raid1 seem to work fine with pretty fast speed over usb 30 connect to my z77base asus mobo there be few drawback i have immediately notice first of all the whole old school way of set it up use dip switch and reset button be slightly annoying especially consider the slightly confusing diagram of the position of these switch in the include manual and the fact that the switch and reset button be locate on the inside of the enclosure so make sure you be in correct mode before reassemble whole thing second of all the include usb 30 cable be pretty short ok if you place the enclosure on top of your case or somewhere close but not long enough if you need to place it somewhere on top of your large desk with your computer below the desk last of all you can not really hot swap your hdd easily you must first remove 4 screw on the back of enclosure and then slide the whole for realame out of the aluminum case in order to remove even a single drive i understand that they do it to decrease the physical size and the cost but i would gladly pay more if i could just open the for realont cover and easily swap individual drive without use screwdriver aside for realom these minor drawback i be pretty satisfied with this enclosure so far and like i say before i think it well worth it current price oh and to those who be concerned about the fan noise do not the fan be relatively quiet it slightly noticeable in a completely quiet room but definitely not annoying and it be more quiet than hdd themselves i have also upload the screenshot of the performance of this enclosure when use 4 tb wd black drive in raid1 mode so check it out if you be interested,Good
awful advertises max resolution of 1920x1200 absolutely do not deliver on that regard leaf green pixel flicker constantly there s an entire line down the left side of the screen in fact if i switch to my other computer and then back to my work computer with the work computer not have a mostly white webpage or image on the screen the monitor will not recognize the signal and say it display outside of the usable resolution too late to return it now,Bad
ok i just receive this dual drive and be pretty excited about buy it i m go on a trip and want to be able to take the photo off my phone so this seem a perfect solution i have a galaxy s7 and the first thing i notice be the drive do not fit very well in the slot on my phone it feel like you have to shove it in to connect the connector slip a bit and withdraw back into the drive so you have to hold it for realom do that once in i use the sandisk memory zone app and be able to move my photo to the drive in no time there be no option to eject the drive before remove it i then put the drive into my pc and immediately my system for realeeze up not sure why i take out a wireless mousekeyboard dongle and then it work fine so something about these two usb item not work together all other flash drive work fine for i once i remove the dongle and put it in my pc the system say there be a problem with the sandisk drive and want to scan and fix it i do not want to do that yet i be able to open the drive and copy the photo to my system again very quickly with usb 30 i m a little nervous to trust my travel photo on the drive if it not reliable 128 gb of photo would be a lot to lose should the drive be easily corrupt i may just have to return it,Average

these almost fit inside an american dime they re small game controller be recognize through otg on my lg g4 so these work you can stick one inside a usb peripheral and just leave it there they should not fall out easily a they have a snug fit inside the male plug these should work fine for small lightweight peripheral since the plug be directly connect to the android device i would not recommend use these with heavy accessory or one that might move the otg connector a lot a that might put unneeded stress on the plug and connector,Good

so far so good this look to be a great dash cam high resolution and even great at night do exactly what i d want it to do set it and forget it record whenever the car be on and the only thing well than the camera be the response for realom pier28 absolutely second to none i d buy sand for realom this guy and i live in a desert regard glare i have order a dash mat to reduce some of the glare for realom my dash i try with a small piece polarizing film httpsmileamazoncoh my godpproductb004x3xfhuredirecttruerefcmcrrypprdttlsol30 and it reduce the glare dramatically especially in the center which may be because it linear polarize but it also really darken the video at night and rather than have to take it off and put it on all the time i m go for the dash mat solution that appear to be the popular solution for resolve the glare issue update 8262015 i ve add a few for realame off the camera the day shot be a couple of day apart but same time of day location and weather condition the night shot be minute apart for realom the same location both show the result of add the polarize film i mention above while it do reduce the glare dramatically it also make all of it a lot dark and with le detail especially at night these shot just convince i to remove the film and just wait for the dash mat update 9302015 the dash mat come in dashmat brand ltd edition model i have high hope for this reduce the glare but it actually make it bad i think it probably just the model of dash mat but i m think i might just end up live with the glare i get for realom my dash asis or preorder the cpl for realom pier28 easier to take off at night and remount for day time than the homemade but cheap solution the dash cam be stoday i learnedl do great and now i have some footage of what the inside of the valet parking in a couple of vega location look like laugh out loud,Good
i instal this silverstone m2ssd thermal pad with a gnometech m2ssd heatsink at the same time i instal these i change out the 1x evga 120 mm fan mount in for realont of a evga cloosedloop watercooler for for 2x corsair sp120 fan in a pushpull config this be all mount in an extremely compact mitx case silverstone sg13b with an overclocked 7700k i7 and a 1080ti sc2 my z270 evga stinger motherboard have it single m2ssd slot on the underback side of the board where be almost no airflow i have a small diverter panel i cut for realom some plastic to try and direct some of the air come off the radiator under the board but the air do not have a clean path to exit before instal the thermalpadheatsinkspfan my samsung 960pro 512 gb m2ssd would idle at 40c have a few program open in the background with a video playing and 10 tab open in chrome the ssd be barely be utoday i learnedize but the temp would quickly creep up to 4550c a more more demanding read load a game or encode a video would spike to 60c and run a benchmark would peak the ssd at 72c where it appear to throttle the speed i be expect to see high temp for realom all of the component of my system due to the mitx case and single intake fan i be not worried about it a much a i just want to try to keep temp down so i could run the system a quietly a possible so i set out to try and improve thing a i mention i instal 2x fan replace a single fan at the same time i install the silverstone thermalpad and gnometech heatsink along with a panel to try and divert some of the air for realom the radiator under the motherboard so i feel the result be about a good case a you can get other than have a fan blow directly across the ssd with everything instal i close the case and boot the system i first notice it take a few minute long after boot for the system to get up to the same 40c idle temp i then launch my normal application and website and notice again there be a delay before the temp start to increase and that increase be slow noticeably this trend continue when do more readwrite intensive activity temp would slowly creep up into the same 5560c range even when use the ssd 100 with a benchmark it take 30 second long for the drive to peak at 72c when you can readwire at 35002100 mbps that small amount of time at full speed be a lot more datum the drive also coolsreturn to idle temp slightly quick than before but it be not a dramatic of a change a the delay in temp increase my good guess be that the extra airflow for realom the new fansducting be have a minimal impact drive stoday i learnedl cool slowly but the add mass of the thermal pad and heatsink be able to pull some of the heatenergy out of the ssd give i more time before the drive will throttle i be never hit 72c in my normal usage so it have not solve any kind of problem a the system be run perfectly fine but i be happy that these part at least collectively have make a noticeable change in the system if someone have a computer where the m2 slot be in a more open location and they could have air move directly over it i believe these part could make a very real difference in the system performance possibly even prevent the ssd for realom get hot enough to throttle all temp obtain for realom cpuid hwmonitor application too long did not read these part do not decrease my maximum temp but they be able to pull some heat away for realom my ssd to slow the increase and provide more time before the ssd would slowhat the hellrottle to control it temperature,Good
i buy this to replace a dangle usb cord that be hang out of an otherwise unused cubby hole spot on my 2008 dodge ram 1500 i have to make a custom plate for the opening but plexiglas be easy to work with now it look like it come that way for realom the factory update 1252016 i have to replace this because it would not pas datum to my new kenwood excelon ddx793 receiver it would only charge the phone i buy a different setup for realom a different manufacture and the new one work just fine i have to 2 because of it not be compatible with my new head unit,Average

i purchase a asus rtac68u wirelessac1900 router a couple of year back to replace a dlink model that have finally die after some year of use at the time i buy the router ac1200 adapter be not widely available be quite expensive a well i make due with wired connect mostly a wireless n adapter at 1st then eventually to the edimax ew7811uac ac600 usb adapter which typically test at about 30mps down58mbps up on the 5ghz band i notice that my tablet and phone in the same room a the edimaxequipped pc be a lot fast to my router with speed of 100mbps down1012 mbps up i m only guarantee 10mbps up by my provider so i shop around and notice that pretty much all of the available wifi adapter and router a well have their share of success and failure the netgear a6210100pas be no different but i choose it over the compete asus model due to slightly well positive review for what it is worth i have ownedown many asus product so that do not make choose any easy setup be fain real lifey straightforward just the usual driver install prior to plug in the adapter to a open usb 30 port i obtain the driver for realom the netgear website and do not bother with the include disk the driver instal fine on window 10 64bit and work great a of this review i do appreciate that netgear provide both a driveronly and a driversoftware option there s already way too much unnecessary bloat that come with so many device these day so it nice to have a barebone alternative the speed of the netgear adapter be roughly 3x that of the edimax but that s not exactly fair give the fact that both adapter use different standard and different usb interface usb 20 for the edimax usb 30 for the netgear pro amazing speed without any setting changestweak see attach screenshot adjustable antenna reasonable price do i mention how fast it be con fain real lifey large compare to other adapter i compare it to not really an issue for i a it sit on a desktop no activity light just an illuminated wps button usb cable could be long none of my con be bad enough to take away any star the performance more than make up for any negative side note i do not purchase the a6210100pas through amazon whose price be 10 cheap a i have a gift card for realom a big box store,Good
i ve use this fan for about 78 week now and i can say that for the price it a decent fan no this fan will not blow you away literally but if you re look for a little air while sit at your desk at work or your computer at home this do a good job the clip be fain real lifey large but work well the fan cover be make of cheap plastic but i have not break it yet and have hold up surprisingly well i think what surprise i the most be how quiet it be it be fain real lifey quiet and most time i do not even notice the sound of the motor the good part be that it power through a usb port if you re lack outlet space or it too far away be able to plug it into your computer or docking station be very convenient,Good

the samsung t1 portable 500 gb usb 30 ssd do so many thing right which be why it such a shame it do one thing terribly terribly wrong but let start with the good pro 1 it adorable i mean really really adorable and tiny it small than you think at 08 thick x 20 long x 04 wide and only 26 gram it make regular 25 ssd in enclosure look and feel absolutely massive 2 it base on the 850 evo with 3d nand so it should be very reliable in the longterm 3 come with a dinky little usb 30 cable while the cable design itself be unique to the t1 a far a i m aware you can use any usb 30 cable out there if you lose the one the t1 come with 4 great speed i record just a hair under 390mbs write and another hair over 430mbs read speed while connect to my 2014 5 k imac and similar speed connect to a 2014 mac mini 5 3year warranty con 1 when you plug this drive into a mac you re greet by a small 128 mb partition with window and mac installation file give that with every external drive i ve ever use i would just wipe the drive and start use the disk i be surprised to see that this do not work on the t1 first you can not format the disk in disk utoday i learnedity it just hang the application and second you have no access to the actual 500 gb it simply not visible uh oh so against my well judgment i instal their utoday i learnedity which put two kext and an executable application on my imac at that point i be able to label the disk use samsungs utoday i learnedity and set a password if i want a soon a that be do voila 500 gb available for my usage but this be simply not acceptable while i understand the necessity of the software if you want to passwordprotect the disk there s no reason to force the software installation for everyone so i load up the samsung utoday i learnedity disable the password and then be able to successfully remove the two kext file and the samsung application for realom my computer at that point the drive be readable on my 5 k imac without any issue and also readable on the mac mini that i have never instal the software on in the first place so at this point i think it a great shame that samsung have force a software installation that keep a daemon run in the background on your mac when for many of we it will be completely unnecessary so here my guide to make this ssd work on your mac and subsequently any mac without any software run assume you re not set a password on the disk 1 plug in your new t1 to your mac after marvel at how adorable it be 2 install the samsung application 3 now your drive should show up fine to read for realom and write file to 4 open up terminal quick way to get to it be hit commandspace bar and then type terminal and hit enter 5 type or copy the follow one line at a time you can also manually do this in finder if you have the knowhow sudo rm r systemlibraryextensionssatsmartdriverkext sudo rm r systemlibraryextensionssatsmartlibplugin this remove two of the three unnecessary file that samsung install 6 remove the samsung application and folder for realom within libraryapplication support you can achieve this this by do the follow a open finder b in finder press cmdshiftg c paste the follow libraryapplication support d remove the portablessd folder this folder should contain only the samsung application so the folder be safe to delete in this case e reboot 7 you re do what s really for realustrating about what samsung have do be that they do tell you how to remove the first two file before you install their software but make no mention of the third fileapplication that keep run in the background i think about dock this review to 3 star out of 5 for that alone but the drive quality make up for it in many way overall this be a great drive it just such a shame that samsung have show a lack of professionalism by their underhanded driver installation process a process that need not exist for many p samsung if you re read this in future ship this drive open ie a 500 gb ssd with 500 gb accessible out of the box you can put the samsung application on the ssd maybe be completely truthful about what this entail but this then give people the option of whether they want your file all over their computer depend on whether they want password protection or not do not force it upon absolutely everyone who want to use this otherwise excellent ssd 4 star out of 5 recommend with the above caveat,Good
i purchase an inexpensive chromebook lenovo n42 with the goal of run linux on it a a low cost long battery life laptop because the chromebook only have 16 gb for the builtin emmc drive i need something to function a a disk for run linux left chromeos on the emmc and dual boot linux off the samsung flash i do a quick performance test on my mac use the blackmagic disk speed test app and it clock in at 80mbs write and 147mbs read the write speed be about the same range a a 7200rpm hard disk other have report that the equivalent sandisk usb drive get too hot to touch but this drive be only slightly warm after get a serious workout after instal galliumos i have a functioning light weight linux laptop with a reasonably long battery life,Good
nice product,Good
these be so nice and handy we specifically want to get plug with usb port with 4 people in the house 2 adult and 2 teenager there be a lot of electronic to charge these do the job great i be surprised however that there be only one plug that go into the outlet the other part be just plastic that go into the bottom outlet for stability we just assume that the top three plug would use power for realom the top plug in the outlet and the bottom 3 and usb port would get power for realom the bottom outlet since that be not the case it do not work in the outlet we intend to use it for an outlet with a light switch control bottom outlet we use put it in another outlet and we be very pleased we make a laptop charging station for under our end table and we use one of the power plug in the close outlet if you find this review helpful please click on the yes below thank you,Good
i be write this review shortly after receive it so if anything change in the come week i will try to update it the drive be very small and very light i buy it for use with a macbook air since the laptop itself have very little main memory i buy the 240 gb size and i attach it to the mba with the include usb 3 cable my wife and i travel quite a bit and i plan to use it to store image for realom our digital camera and unload they when we return i first format the ssd a exfat with the understanding that that format would allow i to share the device between our window and mac computer but when i run a speed test on the ssd blackmagic speed test app i be astonish to find how slow the transfer be you can see the result readwrite 380294 mb in the associated screen shot i have several other ssds that i use on my desktop and they show considerably high speed so i decide to reformat the drive for the mac and rerun the speed test and that be when i find out something i have not see inithanks in advancelly the first speed test i run with the disk format for the mac return approximately the same speed a the exfat format but i decide to let the speed test run through several iteration rather than stop it after it first sequence and the result be both astonishing and depress the write speed drop to le than half of what it have be the first sequence through and i can only assume this have to do with the disk heating up for realom the inithanks in advancel data transfer let the speed test run through 3 or more cycle only confirm what i be see write speed drop dramatically after the inithanks in advancel test see that attach screen shot while the write speed be very disappointing the drive be small and convenient so user may feel it be worth the cost i do not,Average
for the past month or so i have be look for a little bluetooth speaker that i could use in our rather large bathroom i look at a ton of single hockey puck size one that hang for realom the shower and one that hang for realom shower rod they be all in the 30 range and i be about to pull the trigger on one when i see this speaker for roughly the same amount a those small waterproof speaker i could get this one with a lot more functionality though not water proof note again this speaker be not waterproof with that say i just put this speaker on our towel rack and it be loud enough to be hear for realom anywhere in the bathroom without have to have it in the actual shower with i build quality the speaker be build very solid and have a little bit of heft to it when you grip the speaker there be no noticeable flexing or creaking which also attest to the solid build the finish on the handle have a brush aluminum look to it which add a level of class the color scheme be modern and go with the time thank to the beat brand popularize black and red etc one thing i would have like would be a few more color scheme like perhaps black on black and maybe black on dark grey functionality one of the thing i do indeed like on this speaker be the fact that there be so many input option at least 5 that i can tell these be radio fm bluetooth usb thumb drive or usb device mini memory card i have not use one of those in like a decade aux input wsupplie aux cord with so many choice for sound input everyone need should be address i only need this for the bluetooth capability however i do test all the other out sans the mini memory card here be a breakdown of my finding bluetooth connect quite quickly and easily so much so i do not need the manual at all my test device be an ipad air and a samsung galaxy note 5 again they both pair up quickly and the range be quite good i could leave my device out in my 20x20 foot bedroom while listen to music and netflix in the master bath you can use the skip track button on the handle to skip track by single press or fast forward through the song by long press it work quite well radio fm only a there be no visible antenna on the speaker like there be on old school boom box i be surprised that all of the fm station i listen to work well and clearly include a local college run station that station however be a little staticy usb i plug in a usb thumb drive that i have load of file on the speaker scan the drive and start play music there be no way for i to specify which directory it play for realom though this be something i have see on other device that play usb drive more recently on a radio i have in one of my car a with the above bluetooth mode you can use the skip track button on the handle to skip track by single press or fast forward through the song by long press it work quite well if you pause your track and go to another mode and back again it remember where you be and continue play wherever you last leave off aux connection this work just fine connect to a range of device basically just act a an extension of whatever you be play on your device i dint know quite where to mention this so ill put it here on the back of the speaker you have the mini usb port for charge when you be low on battery and begin to charge it there be a light on the back that go red when it be fully charge it go green i know this should be a normal charging function on most device sadly it be not but i m thankful it be here also the battery life on this thing be sweet i have not charge it since the inithanks in advancel charge

loud actually very loud so loud my kid think i be use my studio monitor when i be inithanks in advancelly test out some house mix on it at full volume the bass do tend to muddy a bit but that s expect if you need the bass to be a little strong try place the speaker about 12 to 1 inch away for realom a wall and the wall will aid in do so no lie this be trick sound engineer use often myself a well at certain gig i perform at negative in the picture it show the time on the speaker if this be so i could never imagine use this speaker a a clock a the 3 led in the handle be way too bright they be too bright for a well light room let alone a dark room where you might be try to sleep if the light could be turn off then it would be perfect the annoying bluetooth connected voice yes it nice to know the mode and if you connect but have a voice yell bluetoooose be connect be pretty grate sadly you can not turn the volume down on the connection voice because of these 2 negative i want to give the speaker a 45 all in all for the price this be an excellent speaker the sound and build quality be great excellent value for the money while i receive this unit at a slight discount i would recommend it to family and for realiend and would purchase another at full retail price,Good

i ve have a kenwood unit in my car for the last 5 year or so that have be rock solid that be the main reason i choose this unit when upgrade my gin real lifefor realiend stereo for her birthday the other reason be that this have a lot of great feature and an interface that be not too much or too little the only disadvantage i ve find be the lack of information onscreen it seem crazy to i that just about all of these double din unit use big lettering and narrow screen so despite be twice a big it show about 12 of the information this unit be no exception but it be not a bad a some of the other a an example when i use a usb drive for music on my single din unit i have 3 line of datum trackartist time and date this double din unit show 1 line of scroll info and the time no date the onemain line of info also show le character so you have to wait for it to scroll to see what s play it do have a lot icon to indicate certain thing the icon appear on a second line and i think they appear in the blank space to the right of the volume knob too in my humble opinion that space would ve be well use with 1 or 2 line of small textual information i stoday i learnedl give this unit a 5star because this design flaw be basically parforthecourse if you want a large head unit and it have a lot of other quality that make up for it i have a samsung galaxy s2 and it pair easily i try make a few bt call and it work well except that one person say my voice be a bit distorted they say metallic whatever that mean haha i use pandora on a few commute and it take i a minute to figure out how to switch station but once i do i have no other issue it be fun to listen to my station and be able to thumb updown while drive i instal this on a 2001 subaru outback in customer pic which have a single din cd changer connect to the double din factory unit it be a side bonus to be able to add an extra storage pocket along with the stereo upgrade i purchase the storage pocket and wiring harness for realom crutchfield since they have well price on those item with for realee shipping and include install instruction pretty generous consider i buy the head unit on amazon their shipping be also about 3 time fast by the way the only tricky thing about instal this unit be the fact that i could not shift gear to move the shift knob out of the way on my car 98 nissan altima i can switch down into neutral without turn the car on a long a i have the key in the ignition so that be a pain in the neck with the subaru the sound quality be noticeably well on the factory speaker and there seem to be plenty of flexibility in equalizer setting to get the most out of your music p if you go to the product page on crutchfield they have a video breakdown of all the double din model that be similar to this one it a great way of determine which feature and interface look good for your setup,Good

i want to start by say i give this a 5 star review because after optimize the display and tune the setting this be an awesome display i purchase this product mainly because of the gsync i want an ip panel with gsync at 144 hz with le than a 3ms response time but those option be just way to expensive but with my nvidia gtx 1070 gpu i need gsyn to have optimal setting a a for realeesync monitor amd will not work with an nvidia gpu marketing ploy so this be the good monitor i could find for the price with that be say i ve only have this monitor for le than a week but it be fantastic the fact that angle of view be low because it a tn panel be a bummer seeing a you need to be directly in for realont of the screen for the good clear picture fine for gaming and work not so great when try to relax watch a movie now for set up your pc will auto detect the monitor and set up display accordingly depend on your connection type hdirect messagei or display port however it do not optimally set the setting automatically for you it also do not automatically activate the gsync feature so you will need to adjust your resolution setting in your normal pc management then you will need to open the nvidia control panel and configure it there a well even with use dp it auto set to 60 hz so you need to manually select 144 hz and also enable the gsync feature in the nvidia control panel then on top of that you need to physically configure the monitor set with the button on the monitor itself a the monitor have different display type and resolution etc etc you can select on the monitor itself in the menu so with this being say if i have the nvidia control panel plus an nvidia gsync monitor they should automatically coincide with each other for optimal performance and resolution you would think they do not so the big downfall be have to adjust all the setting which can take some time especially for somebody not so pc savvy i ve play black desert online with this monitor and it perform admirably never once do i get a screen tear or anything of that matter which be nice also with the nvidia geforce experience app the app will automatically tune and optimize your setting for most game i think they have a list of around 350 game right now that the feature work with all in all i will be eventually purchase two more of these monitor to connect to a triple vesa mount a i be very fond of the product in the end also a you can tell this be vesa mountable also the stand that come with the monitor be awesome swivel leave and right adjust up and down and also today i learnedt forward and back you can also turn it on a 90angle if you want be also nvidia 3d vision enable acer predator xb241h bmipr 24inch full hd 1920x1080 nvidia gsync display 144hz 2 x 2w speaker hdirect messagei dp,Good

i would give this a 45 if i could so i ve spend many day search headset try to figure out which one would be good and the good price there be lot of application i use headset for which i will list and have question about which one it would and would not work with but no one really have they list first the sound quality be great i be very pleased with the sound sometimes it cut out but through the various use of application with other program run and with only one program run i ve find that it either the application or my connection depend on how many thing i have run at once there s no feedback and i ve be tell that i m able to be hear clearly no echo no static second the feel be okay i have an average size head it not biglaughing out loud and the headsetit do not feel tight but it aggravate my ear after be wear for a while the cup ear piece be a little weird i have not seenfelt any like these before usually it the foam pad or the material be close to the material of the entire headset they do not feel bad but just a little old i have small ear and they cover my entire ear i include a picture of my ear so you could gauge betterlaughing out loud this be the reason i do not give 5 star but again if i could have give 45 i would have so so far i ve use five9 skype blackboardadobe meeting room with this headset everything sound and compatibility wise work just fine i see where people be complain that the answer call button do not work on the instruction sheet that come with the set there be an asterisk that say you may have to download driver in order for it to work there s also something about another company cisco maybe but i can not remember it may say something like it do not work with they or you have to download the driver for it to work i can not find the instruction right now but when i do ill update it with what it say after you ve do that and it stoday i learnedl do not work you should contact logitech i ve only need to use my volume button so those be the only two i can speak on all application i use have mute option so i have not need to use the mute button in one of the picture i extend the side all the way out so you could see how far it would extend in that same picture i bend the mouthpiece so you could see it flexibility the piece do flip around so you can use it on the left or right side but you have to flip it over and not under it tell you that in the instruction a well see picture i can not think of anything else i hope i do not leave anything out quick update july 19 i plug in my headset today and the sound keep come through my computer i check the sound preference and the headset be not even register i keep mess with the cord and find there be a short in the cord i contact the seller already and they re send out another one that will be here thursday i use the mute button today inside of blackboard and it work like it be suppose to i unmute myself in the application and press the mute button to make sure it work properly when it in effect the little led light be red update july 22 so my new headset come and it too be flawed the amount of feedback in the headset be ridiculous i lower my rating i do 2 star because when it work it great it be a constant buzzing in my ear i have to stop work because of the sound i m pretty peeved and do not order a replacement so begin again my search for the next top headset deep sigh i also attach a picture of the instruction that talk about the call answerend button,Bad

first off i m not a boxee fanboy like many people who be grill boxee over the coal for not offer for realee hulu or netflix on release date or for not use the same interface on the box a in their traditional software i do not know what that interface look like originally and i honestly do not care and even thou hulu plus and netflix have already be announce to be implement before the end of the year for the boxee box i do not really care either since i get for realee hulu access through playon and i watch netflix on my ps3 the only reason i decide to purchase the boxee box be streaming of video file over my network specially high bitrate 1080p mkv file with dts sound which seem to be the weak point of most medium streamer on the market even google tv can not handle dts on mkv and in that department the boxee box totally blow my mind the interface be beautiful and snappy and it play my mkv file without break a sweat fast forwarding be a breeze also a weak point on most network medium player out there and not only do the box automatically fetch the cover art and description of the movie and tv show store on my network but it can even read the inside content of rar file which be awesome the remote be delightful to use and for the first time ever i be able to enjoy youtube on my 52 inch screen and browse it comfortably for realom my couch searching and play youtube file be a breeze thank to the polished youtube app there be lot of for realee video content in the tv show and movie section to keep you entertain for age have in mind those video be ad support since you re basically play they off tv website like comedy central or spike tv to name a few but all of the above be basically a bonus for i like i say the real reason i purchase this device be network playback of video file and in that department it totally blow any machine on the market out of the water a a side note i have the feeling that once netflix be implement before the end of the year on the boxee box along with hulu plus many people will be tempt to cut off their cable company because basically for the 20 buck a month that they would pay for both netflix and hulu plus they re be able to instantly watch more movie and tv show than they can possibly consume over the course of a month i will not go a far a cut off my cable company thou i can not live without hbo and my wife watch international soap opera not available anywhere else be this box worth the asking price i d say it all depend on what do you want the box for if you re look for a netflix or hulu machine there be way cheap alternative on the market but they will not stream your local medium a superbly a the boxee box or they will not stream it at all if you re look for the familiar boxee interface you will not find it here either for that purpose buy yourself a nettop and hook it up to your tv but if you re look for the good network streamer on the planet able to play any video format you throw at it at any bitrate or resolution without even flinch while automatically fetch your movie and tv show cover and description of the web and display they in a beautiful organize snappy and convenient interface capable of tame the vastest medium collection and put it at the tip of your finger your search like mine be finally over the boxee box be the network medium player to end all network medium player finally a company that get it release a product that perform the way it be advertise to perform boxee understand user want for realeedom to enjoy their medium library a they please without have to deal with restrictive platform like the apple tv and now they have put their money where their mouth be by release this gorgeous piece of technology ill post a picture above in the product detail section this thing be indeed sexy i start this review by say i be not a boxee fanboy well i guess after spend a day with the boxee box they just convert i into one,Good
work well fast flash drive i own see attach comparison image to other sandisk flash drive,Good
i m ambivalent about this drive on the one hand it usb 30 fast and it a whopping 4 tb mirror for realom a trust source at a very good price on the other hand it be fussy for i if i have the option of give this 35 star i would it deserve well than 3 star due to the size and the price i ve reformatte the drive with mirror raid 1 create two identical copy of my datum having recently have a hard drive crash that result in the loss of some critical datum i m now extremely paranoid about datum storage that say it a hassle to constantly backup work datum onto a few different drive so this mirror drive take care of that with one process unfortunately sometimes this drive decide to sign off and have to be power cycle to be rerecognize by my computer this would be an easy process if it actually have a power button but it do not the correct process be to eject the medium use the safely remove hardware icon on the desktop unfortunately if the drive be not recognize by the computer then there s no way to eject the medium via the desktop so i have to physically unplug and plug back in the drive which seem unhealthy since the drive itself be stoday i learnedl power up light be on and fan be run this have happen multiple time despite the fact that i ve disabled sleep mode via the supply wd drive utoday i learnedities program the problem seem to occur when the computer have be inactive for a period of time this create another issue since i have backup set to occur when the computer be idle and that process can not occur if the computer can not find the hard drive this mean i need to get into the habit of manually back thing up when i know ill be away for realom the computer for a period of time which sort of take away that extremely important automatic part of the equation the drive be attach to a new dell xps 8700 run win 81 and plug into a usb 30 slot i do not have the computer set to go into sleep mode or do automatic shutdown at any time if this unit do not have the sleep mode issue and have an actual power button it would earn an unequivocal 5star but in it current iteration i d probably consider a small drive for similar pricing a long a it would consistently do automatic backup,Average
i teach software class over the internet which mean i be at my desk eight hour per day i need a headset that would give great performance for sound both my voice and the student and be comfortable for allday wear i investigate several brand and almost pull the string on a jabra headset but balk because of the price then the logitech h650e come across my desk with good feature and a well price after use it for a while here be my evaluation of it pro here be the thing i want that it have stereo sound with coverage for both ear overhead band rather than behindthehead band like my last set businessclass design and construction this one be solidly build and feel like it will last a good long while great quality sound both incoming and outgo my student have give very good review of my voice quality and i can hear they clear a a bell the set be generally very comfortable and include a clip to keep the cable secure to my shirt so that the headset be not pull for realom my head when i move around or by the weight of the cable itself the mute button on the cable be very handy also con some of the feature of the headset be only activate when use compatible software for example the incall indicator light be only useful when on a skype or similar software call it do not activate just because you be use the headset another issue be the volume of my own voice come through the headset when i m talk yes my voice be there but it be very low and i can find no way to adjust it mostly i hear my voice come for realom outside the ear phone rather than through they le than satisfy but not enough to send they back i mention that the headset be generally comfortable but i have notice that by the end of the day my ear be get a little sore and i have to adjust the phone a little to make they feel more comfortable admittedly that may just be my ear note the call connectdisconnect button and the incall indicator light just become le useful to i a skype have stop support those feature even though they say they stoday i learnedl do i be in a class and both feature be work fine i get the notice about a new skype version and instal it now those feature no long work can not get anyone for realom skype to answer my question about the claim that the feature be stoday i learnedl support i ve see nothing for realom logitech about this either if you use skype be aware,Good
this iegrow liion charger be nice than i think it would be when compare to a more expensive namebrand charger it display more information more clearly and offer the option of use a 1a charge rate or a 05a charge rate i test it mostly with the 05a charge rate a that s suppose to be gentler on your battery i charge both 18650 battery and 26650 battery in it and it should work with several more size a long a they be 37v liion do not try to charge 1215 nimh nicad or alkaline battery again do not use with those they be the wrong voltage and will be damage at well watch the input draw you can tell it cycle periodically probably to check the charge level on the battery and update the display i like the fact that it can be use with a good usb wall charger or car charger while that be an extra piece of equipment it offer well flexibility than carry a whole separate charger that work on 110v ac and another that work on 12v dc and most people already have a good variety of usb charger around i d recommend you make sure it be rate at more than 1a output at 5v dc for the slow charging and try to use a 21a or high rate usb charger if you be go to try the high charge rate the display do not track the total amount of mah but do show you the voltage on the battery and a guess at percent charge and a simple graphical representation in addition to the charge rate i do get a discount on my purchase in order to provide an honest review i be be honest when i say i like this one well than the namebrand one and the discount have nothing to do with that at the regular amazon price this be stoday i learnedl a very good buy i hope the picture and review help you with your purchase decision and you mark it a helpful,Good

poweradd travel charger surge protector 2outlet portable travel outlet with dual usb port green i love this poweradd travel chargersurge protector it one of the well design one i ve run into i love that two of the three ac plug will support the oversized brick type plug i love that there be two usb port for all the phone and tablet we carry around it also have an extension cord that let you well place the surge and that the cord wrap around the body and plug into a port this make for easy storage in your luggage and no sharp part expose this be about a perfectly design a i ve own that the green and white color scheme be also cool be a plus too this be my favorite travel surge this product be provide at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review,Good
work just fine nice touch be that each one have a velcro tie which keep they tidy use they a part of my raspberry pi assembly,Good
they be ok i order 5 of these but have to send 2 of they back due to the usb port not work try they on several outlet and several different usb device none would charge a other reviewer state these would not be great to use if you have large power adapter a they will likely block the usb port i basically just want something to replace those long corded surge protector and these fit the bill and provide protection when i remove the faceplace to install these they be very loose i end up put the faceplate back and connect these to the faceplate with the screw and they be much more secure these stick out for realom the wall about 15 in but do not look bad in my opinion they be pretty much out of sigh behind my couch and nightstand anyways,Average
work great with the amd a 7300 cpu no issue to date recommend,Good
i ve be upgrade all my old usb 20 device and hub over the last few year and after a lot of research i decide to go with plugables product base on good review a well a my previous usb 20 hub be plugable brand so far i have have no issue with this hub or any of my other product for realom they i test out every single port to make sure i can charge and transfer datum for realom each one at full speed with my usb 3 device such a my galaxy s5 data transfer fast and device charge fast a expect a you can see in the picture there be also those two flipup usb port in the back which be kind of nice if you have bulkier cable or gadget you want to hide or if they do not fit in the for realont or take up multiple spot i like those back one mostly for device that i do not need to move a lot since it keep they out of the way and keep the for realont port available for example i plug in my wireless receiver for my wireless mouse keyboard that receiver will never need to move so it work good in the back to keep the for realont port open the only very minor negative i can even think of be the bulk of all the necessary cable you can not power 10 device for realom one usb cable so in addition to the usb cable that you ll run back to your pclaptop you need to also run a dedicated ac power cable with a fain real lifey large power brick to an outlet on the wall with good cable management it should not be a big deal but worth point out nonetheless so my conclusion on this be awesome it sound clich but seriously once you go usb 30 you can never go back to usb 20 so upgrade your old usb 2 hub with this one and you will not be disappoint great quality ample power output at each usb port fast transfer speed simply awesome review sample provide by manufacturer,Good
this be the hdirect messagei splitter you be look for personally i have comcast and get sick of pay for multiple box when i just want the same channel to appear on multiple tv i have the hdirect messagei come out of the box attach this splitter use 6 ft and 25 ft hdirect messagei generic cord and viola a perfect signal on both tv side trick download the comcast remote control app and you can change the channel with your phone for realom any room other splitter i try have have issue with picture quality or only show a signal on one of the tv if it will work with comcast it will work for anything give it a try especially if you have have issue with any other splitter,Good
i buy this because i purchase a new case for my wife system with usb 30 header on the for realont and the motherboard do not have usb 30 i look at allot of other card and decide on this one i be not overly concerned with performance but i want reliability and ease of use this card have meet and exceed those need the only thing i do not like be the win 7 x64 system do not have the driver build in and window update do not have they either the card come with all the need driver on a disc so i be not without other than that it a great card i would buy this again in a heartbeat,Good
these be great cable for my nexus 5x i have 5 of they they be well make albeit stiff at first the cord seem to be loosen up and uncurling after about a month of use the length be really good for if you be charge your phone and stoday i learnedl want to use it while watch tv they even come with a little velcro loop to keep the cable coil when you re not use it they plug in snugly to both the charger and the phone i use the checkr app to make sure the cable be safe and be properly specd which it say they be i m very impressed with how nice these cable be and seem to be one of the cheap one to get at this time for the nexus device keep an eye on the price because they tend to swing wildly for realom 1299 to 2499 i wish they come in more color and make a 3 one for my car and for use with battery pack,Good
not bad for a 256 gb usb drive great capacity reasonable price really fast than 20 30 flash drive con a bit big bulky photo be for size comparison slide mechanism not very smooth,Good
great motherboard work so fast water cool work great,Good
very slow for anything other than sequenthanks in advancel readwrite this drive be slow than many of my usb2 drive it be only usable to move large file useless for anything else see customer image for crystalmark benchmark,Bad
this reader work wonderfully out of the box with no setup make all the hardware and driver work on a wide variety of standard in a way that be transparent to the user be no small achievement unfortunately even though the engineer do everything right the factory ruin it with poor build quality my reader work fine for a few month then work intermittently but could be coax back to life be unplug it and plug it back in and finally die altogether the because be a cold mechanical solder joint on the usb socket on the internal board the photo show this faulty joint the solder should be smooth and glassy and wick to the metal surface like water climb the wall of a glass instead you can see it be pull away for realom the metal surface like water on wax this make for a physically weak joint that fail after the usb cable be movedwiggle a little bit and ultimately a failure of all the tiny solder joint that carry the actual datum after fix this not something a typical user have the tool to do it work great i even use it to read the photo of itself to post to this review too bad i can not recommend it to anyone without a solder rework station,Bad
these be describe a left and right micro to micro adapter label on the product bag micro usb to micro usb adapter female end be mini usb the male end be micro usb useless i just want this to convert the exist port to the exact same port at a right angle do not purchase these,Bad
this be build like a tank excellent quality win 7 pro 64 bit recognize all of portable drive and usb flash drive immediately some complain about there be no foot i can see their point but the truth be the user should decide how to position this and the design make that possible it more convenient for i to lay it on it side so that the cable plug in horizontally instead of on top i add four adhesive cushion on the surface where the name appear in the picture since that will be face down i use the clear plastic pad that be a little small than a dime and be widely available at hardware store etc i have no problem with the indicator light which be tiny excellent hub it great to see a device that be not cheap plastic update work fine with 240v i use when travel outside the u and it fine great device i m run four 2 tb wd external drive 2 lexar usb flash drive and a pretty fat wifi dongle all fit easily and work with no issue followup i like this hub so much that i buy a second one for my desktop the first one be for travel with my laptop,Good
i like the size and construction of it it small about 12 wide and 1 12 long see uploaded product picture all metal construction so you should not fear break it the loop work well to hook it on a lanyard it do not include a cap which be perfectly fine because who use those anyway and they tend to get lose rather quickly the write speed be miserably slow to i but for my purpose that s not a big deal because for the use i do one big write inithanks in advancelly and only occasionally add file accord to crystaldiskmark read speed be 185 mb and write speed be 77 mb in copy file for realom my window machine i7 8 gb ram ssd usb 20 i be see actual write speed around 4 mb if you be do for realequent sizable write to the drive i would recommend something fast if your system have usb 30 do not waste your time with 20 drive anymore for what i need though i stoday i learnedl consider this drive a good value and love the design and build quality,Good
this be the real deal it can not get near the new macbook pro 2016 speed but mine configure raid 0 test around 600 mb write and 875 mb read sometimes i get high a the screenshot show but it stay consistent with 600 and 875 of course i back up on a separate more stable drive but i would do that anyway so it not add any bulk to my bag and allow i to edit straight for realom the drive it beautiful too you can not really go wrong with this purchase though it be a high price tag,Good
i do not agree with the other review say this display be not ideal for a macbook pro it true that the 5k display 5120x2880 native resolution scale nicer when you run it at 2560x1440 like most people will when you run this 4 k display at 2560x1440 it basically an inbetween size so your not get true retina graphic people blow this way out of proportion though they act like text be all jagged and blurry yes the pixel density be slightly le but thing stoday i learnedl look very crisp and photo be gorgeous side by side with my 2016 macbook pro display it hard to tell any difference i use to do graphic design and currently do web development so i think i m fair conscious of how thing look on screen both brightness and color be very similar see photo if the 5 k display picture be a 10 i d say this 4 k one be a 9 really split hair here i be concerned that the 60 watt charge capability would not be enough to keep my 87 watt 15 macbook pro go but so far so good your machine will draw more or le power depend on how hard it work when it fain real lifey idle you ll be draw far le than 60 watt so you ll be slowly charge your machine in addition to actively power it i d say my usage be pretty average i surf watch occasional video and usually have itunes open playing music when do these kind of activity the 60 watt be enough to maintain or charge my machine some 60 watt will obviously not charge your machine a fast a the 87 wall charger but i do not really care about that i just like to plug the single usbc cable into my machine and have it feed everything over the single cable and have it not drain my machine over the course of the work day other have report that charge do not work with the include usbc cable or they have to turn it upside down to get it to work i do not experience either of those problem if you re do something super processorintensive like render 3d or video you will be way over the 60 watt on a 15 mbp so your machine will slowly start to drain if this be an all day activity for you you ll need to use your high watt wall charger for most people though the 60 watt should suffice the 5 k display have well image quality due to it high resolution but i like this display because it subjectively more attractive look it have usb port on the back for legacy device a well a other no need to buy a dongle it currently 240 cheap and the difference will be great after march once they take the 5 k off sale it matte screen be easy on my eye and well for glare i be on the fence between get this 4 k display or the 5 k one i ultimately buy this one and be very happy due to the reason above the 5 k be obviously very nice too but give this one a serious look if you re in the market update i have a chance to put the 5 k monitor side by side with this 4 k one there s no deny that the 5 k monitor be gorgeous thing be about 20 sharp than the 4 k a expect base on it high resolution on the 4 k monitor you can almost start to see individual pixel around text whereas on the 5 k you can not compare side by side you can tell a difference honestly though if you just use the 4 k monitor for a while it look very nice too the 5 k monitor be way brighter it so bright that you have to adjust it down about 20 white be very true though the 4 k monitor on the other hand can not get a bright so you basically have to run it at 100 brightness even at that set the white stoday i learnedl appear a tad dull in comparison what i do not like about the 5 k you can not adjust contrast there be no physical button on the monitor and a far a i know there s no way to adjust thing on the software side the color be too contrast and vibrant in my opinion i know it sound weird to complain about something be too vibrant but after use the monitor for a few hour i tend to get eye strain i think it a combination of the really hot color and also reflection for realom the glossy screen overall the 4ks matte screen be very soft and easy on the eye my last monitor be matte so the 4 k feel well to i i really struggle decide which monitor to keep but i ultimately decide to keep the 4 k i really like the 5ks high resolutionsharpness and color accuracy but not be able to adjust thing like contrast and the gloss screen be a deal breaker for i my eye just really prefer the 4 k when they have to stare at the screen for 10 hour a day overall i give the 4 k monitor 4 star it not perfect but stoday i learnedl very good 5 k resolution be really what you want for a 27 monitor but for the reason above i m keep the 4 k for now it kind of stink to buy a new product and not be 100 satisfied for i though this be the good monitor out there untoday i learned someone make a 5 k usbc matte display but that do not currently exist to my knowledge,Good
it actually work with late generation thunderbolt 3 i get it for my new hp zbook g3 and just test it,Good
if you re look for something cheap quick and easy that work and quality be not your top priority then this will work fine for you a almost all other review state the main include software power director 12 have a serious problem with false positive for copyright content even on hometape vhs tape with store buy blank tape when it do this it will stop record video so you will have to stop the tape rewind the tape to where it stop and then start record around the same time again and you will be leave with multiple record file you will need to join together somehow again later to make the full tape recording file kind of a pain there be another big issue possibly with the hardware itself and not pd12 that make it even worse randomly and somewhat rarely the color will mess up so everything look green and purple instead of the correct color for no reason and without warn it not the tape fault a stop and restart correct the color i include an image of what it look like when this happen when this happen you have to stop the recording at which point the color will return to normal rewind the tape to where it start and start record again result in even more file for a single vhs tape you have to deal with later i think cheap hardware be to blame for this one i notice the company respond with have you try ez video grabber which be also include to a lot of people have the copyright issue well this bring in some more problem the ez software be easy to use and do work but limit you to only a few qualityrecording profile all of which result in audiovideo file far bad in quality very noticeably bad than vhs quality which be not good to be with the high quality option dvd quality be decent but stoday i learnedl a little bad than the vhs raw video itself for some reason you can see some compression artifact color be bad and everything be slightly blur also the file size with the dvd quality option of ez grabber be 50 more than that of a well quality power director 12 output file pd12 do have great customization option for output type bitrate etc so you can tune it well if it work so you have serious problem and proscon with either ez grabber or pd do you want to have to babysit these tape a they record through power director and stopstartjoin file etc randomly in order to get a decent recording do you want to be able to just let it go but lose quality and have a large file 6 gb per 2 hour vhs in ez grabber around 4 gb in pd since this piece of hardware use some pretty standardbasic composite audiovideo driver there should not be anything stop you for realom try out other software that be not include in this product that might work well but i have not be able to try any so that be a possible option i be try to digitize dozen of vhs tape of home movie with this product and i be wish i spend a little more on something more reliable do so with this product and include software have essenthanks in advancelly become a second full time job for i just to get out vhs quality digital video file i have to check on it constantly and be there when it finish each tape 247 it ridiculous for some people this should work perfectly though it really depend on your use case edit i be able to figure out the problem that because the weird green coloring of the recording and it be not the device fault or pd fault so i need to post it here for posterity what because that issue be start skype skype seem to cause all sort of problem it probably the good practice to not mess with any software that utoday i learnedize too much videorecordingplayback device when record although nothing else because problem but skype,Bad
it a solidly design drive with satisfy movement of the drive in and out of the case it hold in it hold securely with a slight click feel it have an led light behind the red area give the appearance of a red led light the only problem i have be the read speed and i m include image of the benchmark test do on the same usb port along with my 5 year old kingston data traveler 20 drive i be hope for at least the same speed a my old drive but the read speed be almost half that of the kingston kingston around 21mbs sandisk around 13mbs i get this to stream movie on our blu ray player but with a read speed this low i m hesitant to even keep this for use it good a a backup drive but recognize the speed before you buy it for your need another annoying thing while you re try to transfer to the cruzer be it will fluctuate between 7 and 2mbs so it be constantly update the time to finish i d try the sandisk 30 in hope of at least match the speed of my old kingston at 21mbs but i would not get the 20 again here be the kingston and the sandisk side by side,Average
now this be the sandisk ultra fit 128 gb usb flash drive and it get to be the world small usb flash drive and what s cool about it for photographer be that it fast being usb 3 and also it huge this one here have 128 gb of storage which be pretty crazy but anyway let take a look at it so a you guy might know i travel a lot so the main computer i use be the macbook air now these macbook air storage can not be upgrade so i m go to be use this little drive to increase my storage the sandisk come in at around 80mbs on the write and 130mb on the read pretty impressive for such a small drive other than that i ve really find this to be a cool little product that i m sure a lot of photographer will definitely like to add to their computer for a bit more quick storage you do need to be a little bit careful with it because when it transfer a lot of datum it can get a bit hot but other than that it definitely a winner have a great day guy,Good
we instal this in our edit studio perfect for connect straight into adobe audition and record voice over track no mixer need and way le expensive the vocal quality be very good consider the price we have a lot of professional mic but this setup be far and away all you would ever need simple and fast to setup,Good
product work fine but it have a proprietary usb plug on the device end it not microusb or any of the other lesseruse mini and altoo much informationcrousb connector so you can not just get microusbtowhatever little adapter you have to keep this specific cable around to use the dock i know it an incredibly nitpicky thing but for modern computing we have lot of usb device on our desk it help to minimize the different type of cable and connector we keep around to maximize the reuse of our exist cable,Bad
it work good the only complaint i would have be that the air do not blow up on the side of my laptop where the heat be come for realom in order for it to work i rotate the fan around so the on switch be on the bottom and place the laptop over the top leave fan so it get the air which seem to be work even though this be not how it be intend to be use it do the job and remain steady on the cool plate to bad though that they do not make this to where the cool air also blow along the edge to where it reach the vent that be on the side of the laptop i ve include picture to show what i mean on how i have the laptop place the installation be super easy you just plug one end of the adapter to the laptop and other end in cool plate then turn it on i only wish it would turn off when laptop be in sleep mode plate be not too heavy and at the end of the day i be happy i purchase it because even though i have to modify placement to make it work it now take care of the overheating attached picture show how the top leave fan blue be place to where it hit the area where the heat be come out of which with normal placement it would continue to overheat it also no long smell now that it keep that section cool,Good
this be a fine usb 30 flash drive it be fast recognize at 5gbsec but real world transfer be much slow a 2 gb folder take about 2 minute to transfer this format to mac extended journaled there be a little red light in the triangle on top to indicate readwrite activity remember too that you will only get the fast transfer in a usb 30 port extension port like keyboard be likely to only have 20 port fast for most thing but much slow for large file the drive come with utoday i learnedity software it have mac pc version that can encrypt the drive i have no interest in extra software and delete the file i be glad the eliminate the software be easy some compete drive put software on partition that be extremely difficult to remove for realom a mac i find one big problem with the drive that be due to it retract usb head when you swing the green housing the head extend or retract note in the photo how the head retreat into the drive when the housing be turn unfortunately it do not lock securely in the fully extend position this mean that a you be insert the drive and move the green housing in any way the head begin to retract this make get the drive to fully insert impossible lot of time i find myself fiddle with the drive try to get it to seat securely in the back of my computer the other issue be the green housing make the drive fain real lifey thick and i find i have to wedge into any port that have another cable insert and i also have trouble get it to go into my mac keyboard side port it also come with a short tether that have a little metal ring on the end for attach to a lanyard or key ring the ring be very small and you may have trouble get it onto something in the end it seem that lexar in an attempt to make the drive a little short they make it thick and create a retract head that too easily move in a world with hundred of drive to choose you can do well,Average
instal this in my 2011 dodge ram quad cab install be very easy picture be good and look nice and the kid love the game that be include the only thing i wish it do be play movie for realom the usb port but other then that it work awesome,Good
i buy it for realom a local store a this item stoday i learnedl not available on amazon stay away for realom this device mine be dead out of the box a another user review it on the store website try nearly an hour with tech support and finally i be able to get to the user interface after do 3 consecutive power recycle with 2 time flash interval a instruct by tech support within 3 minute router dead again even before i could finish my inithanks in advancel setup such a wireless network name etc i be take this dead horse back to the store i would suggest anyone want to try this desperately to wait for few firmware update and perhaps a hardware revision i get rev a00 and firmware build 1665xxx there be a new firmware on their site unfortunately device be not hold up enough so i could upload late firmware update i have submit a very detailed update review yesterday itself and it be never appear here for some reason to make it brief i be able to get it run after continuously try for 35hrs and manually push late firmware to the unit after update the firmware it appear to be stable however performance be not close to ac87r range be same but data transfer be 23rd slow compare to ac87r this unit have great latency for upload and download stream check the image only pro i can talk about this time be it vlan feature ui be creepy and many necessary upfor realont feature be hide in deep menu require third party ddns if you need remote access compare to asus provide it own linksys website be not organize if you click on the release note for late firmware it be connect to firmware itself not release note online user manual be a combine version of all international language and if you look for english version you need to scroll down all the way to page 81 really i guess belkin be in a hurry to release this premature baby for customer to do beta testing i stoday i learnedl do not recommend this router yet stoday i learnedl test and will update soon i do not need this much of hassle with a high end router ju to boot this up update rating for realom 1 to 2 just because it be finally boot up,Bad
i buy this thinking it have a circuit that would convert a db15 legacy analog joystickgamepad to a usb hid joystick but it turn out that the usb circuitry be already in the microsoft sidewinder precision pro joystick and some of the early model do not have usb this contain no circuitry and be only a wire passthrough connection that s why it will not work with other joystick to make matter bad it lack a critical connection that put the joystick into usb mode you have to tie pin 2 and 7 together so in order to get it to work you must mod the connector or the controller itself have i know this i would ve just cut off the db15 connector the interface for this be not support anymore anyway and solder on a usb connector per these instruction httpwwwwikihowcomtransformyour15pingameportoo much informationcrosoftsidewinderprecisionprointoausbjoystick a it be i open the bottom of the joystick 6 screw 4 hide by the rubber foot do not force it open find the pin that correspond to pin 2 and 7 on the connector and solder those together a show in the picture,Bad
very good and i get the u1 not the u3 a the description either way it work like magic and 4k recording be no problem either it be exactly what i be look for and definitely recommend it amazingly fast and the usb reader be very handy the packaging be different then what i ve see people put here so i m guess there might be some different versionstype or even replica of this card go aroundso just watch out for that,Good
this be a large capacity 256 gb usb 30 stick at an attractive price i get about 146mbs sequenthanks in advancel read speed and 24mbs sequenthanks in advancel write speed obviously the read speed be gret but the write speed could stand to be improve i dislike the rubber cap for the usb port when place it on the other end of the stick while the drive be connect it do not safely hold in place it be too easy to lose,Average
update after 7 month the usb hub fail cooler master tech support chat very quickly respond and put i into their rma page but for realom there the rma process be awful you have to create an account and verify email and activate with a confirmation link create the product in your account register it and then begin an rma process where you select the product you will also need some form of receipt that you upload to their server at the end of all this they ll take a couple of day to email you backat which time i discover that the cost i have to pay to send the unit back be close to the cost of buy another unit i do not buy this for the hub so i can live without it but this problem definitely keep it for realom be a 5star product i ve get one of the first 17 gaming laptop a sager no problem 9261clevo d900c the thing be enormous but what s more it run hot i ve always need to take a cooler with i and i like have a usb hub a an add bonus when my targus start get old noisy and creaky i decide to purchase the cooler master storm sf this be a fantastic laptop cooler however it be not at all what you d call portableeven the box it come in be the size of a large laptop ship carton the storm sf 19 be a great athome solution but i stoday i learnedl keep my targus in the laptop bag because this unit be actually big than my laptop in all dimension because of it size though cooler master have go out of their way to give you everything they can think of to make this the good laptop cooler on the market the unit be slightly angular so your laptop will be today i learnedt just a couple of degree towards you there be rubber foot and bevel channel all along the top surface so even though my laptop be not a big a the storm sf i have not have any problem with it slide or scooting downward the storm sf 19 be almost completely make of hole the top and bottom surface have a wide mesh screen and the bottom screen be removable to allow you easy access for clean or dust inside the body of the storm sf be two 120 mm fan for those of you not familiar large fan tend to be quieter and the fact that cooler master give you a slider for the fan speed make for a nice way to adjust the noise on this my previous unit just have on and off or lo and hi the other thing about the fan be that they be easily replaceable or even upgradeable they be standard 3pin pc case fan and the manual state that you can use either 120 mm or 140 mm fan with the storm sf mount hardware both fan be secure with a bracket that have a simple release button push and hold the button and the mount hardware come right off push the button in and release when put the fan back on and the spring mechanism grab onto the mesh and hold tight the four casefan screw that mount the fan to the hardware can be unscrewed for replace the fan or just flip they if for some reason you want to reverse the airflow many laptop do not have fan on the underside while some laptop cooler focus on pull air downward with a large gaming laptop this be usually a bad thing because they do have fan on the underside try to suck air upwards and blow it out the back i m glad that the storm sf 19 pull air for realom underneath and blow it upwards what it doing be feed more volume into the four fan that sit on the underside of my laptop because my laptop fan get a volumetric boost more cool air flow through my system and presumably this prolong the life of my fan there s more though this cooler come with it own ac adaptor to pull power for realom the wall it have a 4port usb 30 hub that will work well with the adapter plug in if you have powerhungry usb device the only real oddity here be that the connector cable have a weird configuration it be pinch in a certain way and i think the only reason cooler master do this be so that you d know which of the port must be use to connect the storm sf to your computerno accidentally plug in the wrong port and wonder why your computer do not see the usb hub with all the feature in the cooler master storm sf there s just one last detail that ice the cake of cool the light there be soft glow led in each corner that slowly pulse and can display one of several different color thankfully they can also be turn off it be just one more piece of special fx fun to be able to turn on blue and watch it pulse next to my bluelit razr copperhead mouse and my laptop shiny blue power button if you have a large laptop and some highend hot hardware you can not go wrong with the cooler master storm sf 19 it be not really something you can easily carry with you but in a home setup it be versatoday i learnede easy to care for and will do a great job keep your graphic and gaming for realom overheat on you it a shame the hub be not work for mine but overall the product be stoday i learnedl a superior cooler for large gaminggrade laptop,Good
update two week in and this be stoday i learnedl awesome it have only not automatically connect twice in two week and i be in my car a couple time every day it always a quick fix to just go into the phone bluetooth setting and click the connection this be pretty cool much small than i think it be go to be have it plug in through the aux port because why not if i have one be mostly look for the bluetooth that my car do not have so i would have one le cable to plug into my phone in the car it work great pair to my iphone 6 plus with no problem clear sound both through the radio and aux cable that come with the device can start and stop music control volume skip song on the device have not try a phone call yet but it not a deal breaker if the speaker quality be not good for the price pay this seem like a good product,Good

these cable have a few feature that i find useful the terminator the 35 mm plug be the proper size to fit in the case access hole for cell phone case access hole sound funny but i think you get what i be talk about there phone case have an opening so you can access the headphone outputport the old style plug be too big and need to be shave down with a knife in order to fit into the headphone output of a cell phone with a case not these cable fit right in they also work fit my monoprice headphone with detachable cable i expect that they would fit most headphone with a nonpropriety detachable cable too another feature that i like be the type of jacket on the wire the jacket be the insulation that cover the wire to protect it for realom oxidation and provide a strain relief the jacketing use here be some sort of low for realiction material that result in a cable that resist tangle when you pick it up it sort of untangle itself if you do not coil it like a complete ape because the cable will not stick to itself it have a nice clean feeling in the hand too the two 3foot and one 6foot cable in this pack be a good variety that will work in most situation,Good
i order this monitor after i have some old 1080p tv for my pc i get it for 403 total with taxi and shipping and everything the step up to 4k be pretty awesome may not be for everyone but those who have a pc capable should definitely consider i like the stand that come with this one i be look at the samsung u590d but the stand do not look a good on that one the warranty be also another option to consider samsungs warranty be only good for a year and asus be 3 year the well buy be this monitor i think and i get this one cheap than the samsung at the time now i hear this monitor share the same panel a the samsung model it be a tn panel which be not a good a ip but it stoday i learnedl look really nice luckily this have the stand so you can get the good view angle possible while use it i have play some game on it i have play gta v fallout 4 and doom at the time of write this review the game look superb and i for realequently notice detail in game that stand out in 2160p the only con i ve notice so far be that i have both my cable and my pc hook up to this monitor and when i leave my pc idle and it go to sleep mode it change input on it own i solve this by instal caffeine on my pc so it do not go to sleep mode and by simply turn off the monitor when i do not want my pc or cable on would be nice if it do not change by itself even when my pc be in sleep mode the verdict i ve be look at take the step to 4k and i think i make the right choice with this monitor i would recommend if you re look at a good price 28 uhd monitor update update this review because the monitor randomly switch for realom 60hz to 30hz if i know it would be this big of a problem i would ve never buy this monitor stupid problem that continue to happen,Average

i buy the 16 gb model of this drive in fact i buy two of they the first question most people would ask be why with 32 64 and even 128 gb drive cost only penny more why buy such a small capacity the easy answer be because that s all i need in today technology the most common medium to use to make a restore disk for your computer operating system be with a usb thumb drive for most laptop these day that s the only medium you can use a typical restore disk need between 9 12 gb of storage room make a 16 gb drive the ideal capacity why sandisk a restore drive be one of the most task critical thing i can do and it important to i to choose the brand i trust the most to date i ve never have a problem with sandisk so choose they for this task be an easy decision a far a which model out of a seemingly endless selection of choose for realom this one have the feature that the plug end withdraw into a protective she will that s a plus if you re concerned about datum protection and it have a large flat area on the side of the case to label the content a restore disk be useless if you can not easily find it the drive be small and easy store speed the speed of drive like this be not always the most important thing in fact it never be data integrity be always first some task like restore an operating system be go to run at the speed they want to a fast drive be not go to make that much difference always choose dependability a your first priority,Good
i have a number pad that suddenly stop work so i make a quick decision pick a random keypad and order it it appear that i make a good choice this keypad feel good when you press the key they re not at all sticky and they do not click or make a lot of noise while use the keypad it have a nice bright blue light to show that the unit be turn on and numlock be activate the light turn out when numlock be deactivate on the keyboard the keypad be lightweight however it have nice rubber pad on the bottom to prevent it for realom slide around your desk while use it it a really nice unit at a good price,Good

cable come quickly and the installation be fain real lifey straight forward i use a 118 29 mm hole see show in attach picture to create a hole for the receptacle end of the cable this allow it to have a snug and flush fit such a tight hole may not have allow for the cover which be supply with the cable however i do not intend to use the cover the cable be supply with two nut both of which be quite tight when thread onto the receptacle end of the cable i use some lubricant but it do not help too much while i be able to get the nut tighten it be not a easy a it should have be this lose the cable 12 star my main issue with the cable be that it have a significant voltage drop and this because i to drop the rating another whole star to test the voltage drop i first place my usb direct messagem on an anker 4port usb car power supply aka2240011 anker quick charge 30 usb typec 54w 4port usb car charger powerdrive 4 for galaxy s7s6edgeplus note 54 and poweriq for iphone 76splus ipad proair 2mini lg nexus htc and more this thing by the way rock the power supply easily supply 100a at 512v a show in the attached photo i then plug the male end of the usb cable into the same anker power supply and put the direct messagem into the receptacle of the cable i find that draw the same 100a the voltage be down to 455v that s a drop of 057v now this cable do not purport to conform to the usb 30 standard it actually do not say what standard it build to a far a i can see so perhaps i m expect too much assume it a usb 20 cable it should be able to deliver 05a without a problem and i ve get some similar 6 usb 20 cable which do not seem to have a problem supply 100a with a minimal voltage drop therefore i d like to see significantly le than a 05v drop with this cable at 100a a i do not expect to use the usb portion of this cable too for realequently and the audio jack do work fine i ve round my overall score up to 4stars,Good
just a big thumb drive do not expect ssd speed even with a high end usb 30 controller it kind of sad that a reputable company like visiontek will setup their benchmark either use super specific setup to optimize performance or be just not be truthful not a huge deal a i will find some use for it but come on guy do not advertise 440 rw if your write speed do not even approach 200 i get 150200 max see photo oh and bmd speed test be the industry standard for medium professional so do not try to blame it on that because it represent real world operation not some fantasy number your computer come up with to beat your next door neighbor build your lucky you get 3 star,Average
i ve have mine for quite a while now it stoday i learnedl a good a the day i buy it,Good
this case be excellent i do not know why it half the price of a corsair just brand name maybe anyways this case have no brand paste on it so it really feel like your i accidentally drop the side panel on the floor and crack the wooden flooring and bend the corner of the panel be very careful when handle the side panel do not drop they i solve this by use tweezer to bend the metal to be straight and i put a hello kitty sticker on it it very easy to scratch the paint and the glass so be wary of that too,Good
this toshiba canvio be a small portable hard drive that be relatively fast and offer usb 3 speed the only instruction that come with the drive be a small picture that show how to connect the cable to a computer and the drive the first time i connect the drive to my window 7 box i receive an error message that no driver could be find i try connect the drive again and window 7 then find a driver for it my computer do not have a usb 3 port so i be connect at usb 2 speed the toshiba drive do seem relatively fast however i find that if i slightly move the drive the drive would disconnect the usb connection to the computer be fine but the usb connection at the drive have be very flaky see the image that i upload if you want to see the connector and lately i have be have trouble establish a connection when i first plug in the drive so i m wonder if there will come a day that the usb connection will totally fail pro small and light so it easy to carry would fit in a shirt pocket use power for realom the usb source so no power cord be need usb 3 speed be advertise a 10 time fast than usb 2 but in real life it may only be 3 or 4 time fast con the usb 3 connector that attach to the hard drive provide a very unstable connection if your motherboard do not support usb3 you will be connect at usb 2 speed but with a desktop computer you may be able to add a usb3 card to your computer some usb port may not offer enough power for the drive,Bad
excellent quality micro usb cable i d already purchase several set in white and know that these black one would hopefully be the same the white one that i ve have for quite a while have prove their durability in application such a my car where they take a lot of abuse they have hold up long in this application than any other micro usb cable that i ve try i m look at you motorolanice durable cable but they will not fit through the usb opening in my case the round edge overmolded connector head be heavy duty with good quality strain relief and thick cable these really help durability without be too stiff or bulky some of the overmolde end on other micro usb cable be a bit too square and large interfere with my phone case and prevent positive insertion clearly aukey be use somewhat heavy gage wire conductor in this product a the cable easily pas my charge current test the cable support 1800 ma 18 amp on my galaxy note 3 which be the max that this device internal charger can accept please see the attached screenshot show 1800 ma charge current lesser cable especially at the great length 1 meter or long have reduce charge rate sometimes a low a 450 ma i be very pleased with the quality durability and charge performance,Good

just get this today so i have not have a ton of time to really put it through it pace i do want to comment on a few thing though first people be rightly anger by the requisite samsung software because of the encryption feature offer by the drive it have to be activate before use it which require run a little samsung app include on the drive for realom there you can disable password protection entirely if you prefer which will make the drive unencrypted and usable on virtually any device that support usb if you choose to leave the encryption on and set a password then you will have to use the samsung software to unencrypt it each time you plug it in and therefore you can only use the drive on a pc run window 7 or a mac none of that be particularly annoying in itself it a onetime procedure and take mere second however run the app install a daemon process on your computer that will start at boot and run all the time grant this do not use any cpu unless the drive be plug in and only sit on a measly 24 mb of ram but i m a background process purist if it do not need to run it should not be there the reason for this process be the encryption should you choose to use it however then samsung should disable this daemon if you disable password protection i be able to remove it but i also know quite a bit about computer for a layperson it would likely be very confusing if not impossible to figure out how to remove it so ill detail the step here for window pc since that s what i m use i believe another reviewer detail mac removal procedure already 1 open task manager either use ctrlaltdel or by rightclicke the taskbar 2 find the samsung t1 ssd daemon process in the list easier if you sort by process name and kill it 3 open windowsfile explorer and navigate to cprogramdata 4 delete the samsung apps directory you find there because of this i dock a star it seem like a great drive otherwise but samsung really mess up with the encryption feature first the drive should come a a standard drive no activation necessary and just include software to enable encryption if you want it second if you put anything on a user pc you should provide a clearly mark uninstaller to undo that samsung failure to do so in this case be a hugely idiotic move that say this do seem to be a good drive it look nice feel nice it super small and match my razer blade really well also a you can see for realom the include screenshot it hold it own against my internal ssd also manufacture by samsung pretty well for an external drive the first image be the crystalmark benchmark for this drive the second be the benchmark for my internal ssd a you can see they re really close for the most part which the major difference boil down to mostly the readwrite optimization ratio between the two in particular my internal ssd seem to be optimize mostly for read with write come in rather low for an ssd however an internal drive be go to spend far more of it life read than write so that make sense the samsung t1 seem to have a more balanced optimization,Good
long cord and heavy strip but the power button be extremely cheap and loose it will not last a week of turn onoff for a la vega company i d think the english in the manual would be a bit well this be ridiculous,Bad
this thing be tiny with barely a footprint it also provide extremely fast speed compare this to my old 16 gb corsair flash drive which be about 5 time the size very nice 1010 would buy again edit almost half a year later the drive stop be detect tried multiple mean of fix it but to no avail at least it be great while it last,Bad
this 128 gb card perform very poorly on my m surface pro 3 read write be inconsistent and the card get hot the low speed record be 33 read and 245 write i only find that the card perform when use the usb adapter even then it maxe out at 200 read and 8090 write if you plan to use this card in anything but the usb adapter do not expect it to perform i use crystaldiskmark for test the highest speed test when instal directly in the m surface pro be 80 read and 50 or 60 write,Bad
let i preface this review by say the quality of this item seem impressively high the guage of wire and insulation use on the cable be great the connection to the back of the flushmounte socket be solid however the plastic nut use to secure the socket in the hole be too big they do not thread this effectively render the whole thing useless for it intend purpose my only option be to use adhesive which will look terrible and risk make it nonremoveable incase i need to replace it five star for quality zero for the purchase be a waste of time and money due to the part not fitting if i can contact the seller and get a replacement ill bump to 5 because i know mistake happen see a this product come directly for realom a factory in china i m not hopeful,Bad

i buy this radio to replace a kenwood cd player that have a usb input on the for realont i use the usb port much more than the cd so when i find out they sell medium receiver such a this one i be happy it be light and small than a regular cd player that make installation in my gmc pickup well because of the shallow opening this radio do what it suppose to do however there be several thing about it that be annoying i agree with several other review that complain about the clock or lack of view of the clock when you hold the clock button it display for about 10 second and then go away very annoying because i be in my truck a lot and i constantly look over to see the time i guess i will have to buy a small stick on clock but how will i see it at night another annoying feature be the display it be constantly flash and scrolling information some of which be not unnecessary this should be an option to decide what information you want display i will try to upload a video of this i will also put up a picture of the radio instal in my gmc pickup i use a mini usb thumb drive that only stick out le than half an inch i will eventually change to a sd card the usb drive be 8 gb and i have over 1000 song in about 55 folder and it not even half full no more stack of scratch cd lay around in my truck this would be great for a semi too i have ton of comedy cd on mp3 and that could keep i entertain for hour not to mention downloadable podcast that could be put on usbsd pro light and small easy to install usb and sd slot display be bright volume knob be large and easy to turn not small like some radio con clock and display annoying navigation could be easy change folder for example require long press button no remote for le than 40 i guess that s ok sound quality be not a good a factory stereo but acceptable the include wiring harness have a confusing extra plug have to clip it off to use my scosche connector for my truck not a big deal if you be a little technically inclined conclusion for le than 40 it ok i want something cheap to put in my old truck that would play mp3s i might upgrade it to a well name brand someday or if i buy a new vehicle but for now it do the job i be very happy to find out that they be make medium player for vehicle if you be look for something to play usbsd card and do not want to spend 80 plus i would recommend the bos medium receiver,Good

oh tiny projector i have so many mixed feeling about you on the one hand you ve get a lot of problem but on the other hand you do exactly what i need you to no seriously this thing be hella flaw it noisy the case be full of annoying little light leak that always manage to go right into my eye the focus capability be limited and you need 800 different cord to hook it up to your phone which should really be do via bluetooth a charge last such a short time there s barely reason to bother but i get it to project video on my ceiling while i m lay in bed instead of have to hold my phone in for realont of and inevitably drop on my face for that purpose it kind of perfect i just keep it plug in hold it on it side plug in my headphone and bam instant theater of course that s really the only function it qualified for so if you re look for a streamlined portable projector your money would be well invest into something higherquality a a bedtime pal however it a useful though overprice quality consider little gadget protip get the version without the battery i wish now i d get that one,Average

this be an excellent keyboard with very nice blueequivalent switch clicky with tactoday i learnede bump with a very attractive metal mount plate that act a an exoskeleton for the keyboard give it a great amount of strength and rigidity the only noticeable downside to these keyswitche be that they present a little bit of key wobble when compare to genuine cherry switch but nothing noticeable or even slightly hinder when type in these regard this keyboard greatly exceed my expectation and have be a pleasure to type on i do not see myself replace the main body of the unit untoday i learned it start physically fail however despite the excellent mount plate and the goodvalue keyswitche there be a few unmistakable flaw with this keyboard first off and most obviously the keycap be absolutely not doubleshot injection mould on the nonbacklit version of the keyboard they re screen print and the printing on they be not very good see attach picture you can also see a little bit of keyshine already form on they because the material they re make for realom be rather cheap ab and i ve only be use this keyboard for a few month now the keyboard be deliver mid december 2016 if you re worried about the notsogreat keycap consider this board a blank with complementary cheapo keycap include so you can use it right away because for 40 it a great fullsized keyboard like i say before the keyswitche be very functional cherryequivalent and they be compatible with pretty much any cherrytype keycap you can find online the back of the keyboard be very plain with small but not spindly little raiser on the back end which do not have any grip to they by the way with tiny little pad near the for realont these skid pad in the for realont do not do their job very well a you can see for realom the attached photo that they hardly make contact with the desktop at all when the foot be raise couple with the fact that the keyboard be not very weighty it do slide around on your desk with little force but i ve never have it slide around while type and personally i do not think that would be a problem people would face the number lock cap lock and scroll lock led in the upper righthand side of the board be pretty bright but only slightly bright than the logitec logo on my g402 mouse and lean more towards true blue whereas the logitec led lean more towards cyan but not by much finally the branding badge up at the top center give off quite a bit of reflect light for realom almost any angle due to the circular nature of the engraved corrugation this could be a pro or a con depend on what you like and be definitely not a dealbreaker for i and a a small note on my model a show in the image the machine screw on the for realont of mine be paint black which be something i actually prefer while in the product image they re not paint at all overall this be a great entrylevel keyboard for anybody look to get into mechanical keyboard or maybe for enthusiast look for a cheap alternative to a full set of blue switch on a metal backplate a it pretty affordable and the part that matter most be the part that shine the most in this product in my opinion plus since it get cherry style switch it somewhat customizeable,Good

i recently purchase this two pack because i get tired of buy the cheap 3 ft short cable that charge slowly to short to talk and charge and break down after a few month of use after do the math i decide that replace cheap cable every few month cost more than buy one or two premium cable that will last a few year after some research i decide to try out the anker cable all of their cable get good review and their new one have the good quality life span and look well than their old model but do not get i wrong for realom all the review they be good one a well plus they come with an 18 month warranty since i need two 6 ft cable for my car i end up go with the 2 pack 6 ft nylon braid cable they mostly stay hook up in the car but every once in a while they come out when i need to charge my gear on location the cable came wrap in velcro style wire tie with a thank you card that s package in a simple box the cable have gold connector that you find on the more expensive premium brand the cable they be also wrap in a nylon material i like the look and feel but they show stain easier now it almost impossible to remove those stain without get the cable wet i do not know if wet the cable will damage they but i prefer not to find out a to the quality they look to be well make and look like they will last for year and will outlast a m any bend and twist you can throw at it when it come to charge they charge fast a long you have they hook to a premium charger do not have to be fast charger they will charge fast than those cheap chargercable option out there if you need a two set of cable or want to have an extra one in your gear then this be the product for you two for the price of one take a look at the picture that i upload and see the cable in action,Good

where to start with what i love about this cable the chief thing be that it be exactly what it say it be and be very good at it due to the number of bad usb c cable that exist on the market when i get my nexus 5x i do some research and get a short list of reputable cable thank to the for realiendly google engineer who have busily test they for the community at large this one pas with fly color so not only do it have the right connector but it work a advertised and have the proper power output to prevent short out the hardware the next thing would be that the cable have a good color it appear a bit dark in the picture online to i but it could be a normal variation and that it appear to be for realee of extra snag of string for realom the braid that i ve see on many braid cable it also have a very heavy gauge wire feel make it feel like it will last for many roll up moment in my pocket the connector on the end also be very secure and the metal casing on the end be a nice touch for the charge aspect on my nexus 5x it have work wonderfully it fast charge my phone and have not give i any reason to doubt it will continue to do so for age overall this be a cable that i would recommend to my for realiend and family for their device with a usbc connector it may not be the cheap but it look nice feel nice and will not for realy your equipment because it be not make to usb spec,Good

this cable be very high quality and you can tell by the look and feel of it the connector be the same size a any other micro usb cable but these be 24 karat gold plate which be definitely nice a it will help conductivity in comparison to a regular micro usb cable it seem a if this one might be a slight bit heavier likely due to the nylon braiding although it be not very noticeable and certainly not something that would detract for realom it value or usability it do seem a if charge be slightly fast due to the well conductivity i do not notice any difference in data transfer rate when copy song to my galaxy note 4 although it be very difficult to tell since song be usually relatively small file the additional 3 foot of cable be much nice for data transfer and charge though if you be look for a premium quality micro usb cable or even just something that be a bit long than the cable that come with your phone then this be definitely ideal for you i be extremely happy with this product a it be exactly what i be look for although there be cheap 6 foot micro usb cable out there the gold plating 18 month warranty and excellent customer service for realom anker can not be beat,Good

i have a 2011 mbp that have thunderbolt usb 20 and an ethernet port the problem with these old computer be that while they have a large variety of port than new mac they be limited to the pathetic speed of usb 2 i have an ssd usb 30 drive that have my lightroom library it plug into my imac at home but on the road i like to use it with my 2011 mbp to access the same lightroom library the problem be that it be a lot slow since it can not take advantage of the usb 3 speed the startech come along right a i be consider the new mbp the new mbp only have usbc port so a product like this combine with a thunderbolt to usbc adapter will add ethernet and usb 30 to one port i plan to test this when i get my hand on the new mbp for my current purpose i plug my usb 30 ssd into my usb 20 port on my 2011 mbp the speed test show a read and write speed of 303 and 348 mb so slow but it be what i deal with because i do not want to buy ssd thunderbolt drive because they cost so much more i then unplug the ssd plug in the startech device and the speed increase 10x 3532 3556 respectively once again the save grace to these 2011 mac be the often criticize thunderbolt port the current price of this device be 82 but that be typically le than the price differenthanks in advancel between a 256 usb 30 drive and a 256 thunderbolt drive in this case it will also be nice to have with the new mbp so it have some staying power that will make it worthwhile if you want to use it ethernet port which be not available on the new mac and also have access to a usb 30 port one thing i should mention be that this be plug and play with my 2011 mac i simply plug it into the thunderbolt port connect it to ethernet and to the usb 30 drive and everything be up and run in second also the size and weight of this thing make it easy to toss in the bag with my ssd drive if you be in a similar situation where you be stuck what the hell usb 2 port but have a thunderbolt port i highly recommend this device if you be look at new mac and the require dongle it may be cheap to get a usbc only device but i like the flexibility of use it with my current mac and my future mac,Good

briefly this table be what it be a budget turntable for people try to get into vinyl lp like i the first tn300 i order have a slightly warp platter so i contact amazon for a replacement turntable which i receive very fast second turntable do not have any issue therefore i give this turntable a 4 star rating i d give it 5 star if it be not for the first mishap because for the sale price i buy it at it be a very decent budget turntable because i believe that many people be curious how to mate the ortofon 2 m red cartridge with the teac tn300 turntable i though this review be worth put some time into in the owner manual it state that the tn300s tonearm can support up to 65 g cartridge the 2 m red weigh in at 72 g so it appear to be out of the weight range for an acceptable cartridge however the 2 m have a slightly low vertical tracking force vtf of 18 g whereas the recommend tracking force of the audio technica at95e cartridge that come standard on the tn300 be 20 g not a big difference but i figure that it help narrow the gap of the acceptable cartridge weight i then start look into heavy aftermarket counterweight that would have no problem counter heavy cartridge however the one i find be pretty pricey and i be not willing to spend over 50 for a 5 piece of metal with a hole drill through it i think about make my own but i have just build a custom suspension shelf for my tn300 and just do not have the motivation to follow through i really want the ortofon 2 m blue cartridge however cartridge be one of the few piece of turntable equipment that seller do not accept return on and it be stoday i learnedl unclear whether it would work properly on the tn300 if it do not then i would be stick with a 250 cartridge i could not even use the 2 m red be price at 100 and i be willing to risk that much money for the potenthanks in advancel gain in sound quality and admittedly the add aesthetic of the ortofon 2 m red so i purchase that option now in order to install this cartridge you will no exception need a cartridge alignment protractor and a turntable stylus force scale you can use a paper protractor but i buy one of the mirror protractor that hook over the spindle i also buy one of the cheap digital scale which work fine i work in a molecular biology lab and test how accurate the scale be use standardized brass weight 5 g and it be pretty spot on about 001 g installment of the 2 m red be pretty smooth however because the 2 m red exceed the tonearmcounterweight limit you can not zerobalance the tonearm like you normally would so what i do after instal the headshell with the 2 m red attach be gently install the counterweight and move it down the tonearm in the direction of the headshell untoday i learned you just feel the counterweight slide onto the rubber groove if my memory serve i right with the counterweight at this point the vtf be about 1113 g so you will never be able to achieve zero unless you add more counterweight to the back of the tonearm once the headshell be instal i align the cartridge use my protractor and then dial in the vtf to exactly 18 g use my digital force scale so for realom my perspective budgetoo much informationnde audiophile everything have be adjust properly and the ortofon 2 m red will indeed work on my tn300 now one issue i notice immediately after all of my adjustment to accommodate the 2 m red be that the ortofon have a slightly large height for realom the top of the cartridge to the tip of the needle so eyeball it appear that this because the 2 m red cartridge to track about 23 off for realom be perfectly parallel with the tracking surface if you ll notice look closely at the stock tn300 headshell that the screw mount hole be recess on the top of the headshell which because the mount groove to protrude about 115 mm below the top of the headshell this protrusion combine with the add height of the 2 m red and the fact that there be no option to make vertical tonearm adjustment on the tn300 result in an issue for i i believe that eliminate this bottom protrusion would result in correct the angle of the cartridge however i do not want to destroy the stock headshell a angle headshell be much more difficult to find than straight one so i purchase the denon dp300f angle headshell assembly this headshell do not have any protrusion on the bottom and i believe this be my solution a it do mate with the tn300 tonearm very nicely so presently the 2 m red be instal on the denon dp300f headshell mount on my tn300 and have help correct the angle problem mostly i believe that there might stoday i learnedl be 1 discrepancy but i be ocd throughand through and be satisfied with the result a far a appropriate mating between the 2 m red and the tn300 i be sure some walletloade audiophile who can afford 1500 audioquest cable will say that the resonant for realequency generate by the 2 m redtn300 tonearm combination might be inappropriate and will not produce the good sound however since i do not own a 20000 turntable setup i be certain i will never be able to detect a difference and i doubt most of you will either so currently my setup on the tn300 include ortofon 2 m red mount onto a denon dp300f headshell emotiva xps1 phono preamp one of jakes leather turntable mat and a sleeve city record weight lowprofile enough to fit inside the turntable cover when it be in the down position the emotiva preamp be connect to a pioneer elite sc75 receiver hook up to two klipsch rp280f speaker for stereo sound when listen to record i live in west texas so lot of static electricity and the leather mat helped eliminate about 50 of my static electricity issue get a humidifier for my apartment helped eliminate about another 20 i can not say that the emotiva make a significant difference worth 150 it do help boost the output a bit but i do not notice any dramatic improvement in sound quality so in my opinion the internal phono preamp in the tn300 be pretty solid because i now have two headshell at my disposal i have have a chance to ab test the 2 m red against the at95e and i can say that the 2 m red be an improvement not gamechange but it be an improvement i would agree with most of the review in term of sound for the 2 m red on amazon so i will not go into a lot of detail but there be a bit more clarity and vocal sound much well which be what i be aim for the most pleasant surprise be the improvement in my bass response the bass for realom the 2 m red be much more punchy and succinct than the at95e i feel it be important to note that the rp280fs can put out a lot of bass so other might not experience the same improvement i do overall i be happy with the upgrade and the ortofon 2 m red denon dp300f combination it certainly look very sharp hope this review help anyone try to determine if the 2 m red will work with this turntable,Good
i have not purchase a portable dvd burner drive in a while i be impressed with the fit and finish and performance of this drive it download song for realom my cd really fast fast than my old blue ray burner best of all be the eject function it fully eject the disc all the way out which be awesome,Good
mpow send i this unit to review and at first i be not sure how useful it would be after use it for a while i realize have an audio and power solution combine into a single adapter be actually very helpful on the plug there be a usb port for charge your device which be great because not all fm transmitter offer this and therefore require a separate adapter which clutter your vehicle go along with minimize clutter there be a velcro strap on the cable which allow for cable management a someone who dislike clutter i appreciate these little step mpow take the fm transmitter be nice and simple with only two button up and down all you have to do be plug the cable into a 35 mm headphone jack and tune your fm radio to the station show on the display and viola you have audio a you can see this be a very simple gadget that be a must have for any road warrior,Good
i volunteer to review this product because i need a way to organize all the accessory for my phone and tablet in my backpack this pouch do all that really well it hold my cable various small device and charger neatly so i do not have to dig through my bag to find they it have solid stitching and a nice chunky zipper it be make for realom quality material and have a significant feeling to it that make it seem like it will last,Good
context i m a photographer that s always on the go i keep my lightroom library on an external drive since it so massive i have previously be use a lacie rugged drive which work nicely but i run out of room having recently purchase a macbook pro retina i now have both usb 30 and thunderbolt the choice be not only what capacity and manufacturer but which connectivity method a well usb 30 v thunderbolt thunderbolt look like it go to be a great technology in the future but it currently in it infancy not only that you pay a massive premium i first purchase a lacie 2 tb little big disk only to have it show up doa for realom another big retailer not amazon it be only after that fiasco that i realize something i need at least 1 tb so that mean within my budget i m relegate to hdd not sdd therefore my speed be actually limit by the hard drive itself not the connectivity method with that new realization i be between this drive and the lacie 1 tb rugged thunderbolt and usb 30 external hard drive with too many bad review out there and cost more than twice the price i decide it just be not worth it this little wd win build this appear to be a pretty quality piece it feel like plastic to i but it fine finish feel very similar to the mbp finish and they look identical wd be not joke around about the whole for mac thing be it a durable a the lacie rugged drive i m used to i have no clue and i do not intend to find out i m very careful with my belonging and i ve never drop or damage something like this i guess ill continue to be careful and see what happen a time go on in general i transport small valuable item in pelican case they re the good they re a major reason i ve never really damage any of my belonging performance i run a few test and i average a 115 mb speed for both reading and write not bad certainly well than usb 20 or even firewire 800 i m not sure what else to say it fast value it great speed nice compact build and terrific look all for a very reasonable price go with usb 30 over thunderbolt be the right choice for i at this time i m very happy with my purchase,Good

solid microphone audio quality be great get this microphone back in late 2013 do not bother to review this untoday i learned now pick up subtle background noise any background noise really heck this mic be so sensitive it could pick up the next door neighbor mow their lawn if your wall be thin and cheap enough for fix the background noise get into the quiet room possible if you can no duh either that or adjust the gain for the mic in the audio setting on your computergotta talk louder andor close to the mic voice echo off for realom the wall get a soft blanket around your mic and head gaming and can not hang a soft blanket around back of your monitor i do that fix the problem right up or just get a foam covering for the mic solve some problem there if sensitivity be a problem or a worry they can be ignore because any other condenser microphone have the similar compare this to the at2020 there s not many difference other than look and the for realequency which of the two can recorddetect it not like your voice be ever go to hit a 20000mhz pitch the 2020 can detect versus the 15000mhz this can respond to am i right now to the stand the stand be plastic at first handle the mic feel surprisingly heavy in which the stand could not possibly hold but it do just be careful now i strip my stand while carelessly screw and unscrew such a cheap little plastic over a time span of two year use a see in the picture post the led other reviewer be complain about yeah it blinding fix it with a little duct tape life problem solver literally cool addition be voice relay via the 35 mm audio jack and also volume button the two little nifty button on the for realont of the mic be use to adjust gain aka mic volumesensitivity and also computer volume when plug a male 35 mm jack for realom some speaker or headphone for say into the female 35 mm audio jack output on the mic you can hear yourself and also have computer audio passthough no delay for the two it instanthear how you sound if you attempt to turn down volume with the button it ll turn down the computer audio and also voice relay nope you can not keep the two separate for just adjust one with the button so you re stuck with that overall i think not have two separate control for gain and computer volume be simply a bummer it an all or nothing predicament here if you re worried this will not work with your version of window do not worry i ve test this on window operating system range for realom win7 to 10 it all work on every one of the o in conclusion this be great well know brand name starter condenser mic for the entry level gamer vocalist podcaster or voiceover hobbyist if you re debate against the blue yeti or the at2020 versus this but really do not feel like spend the extra money this be a great buy two year of use for realom this great mic would confirm my decision,Good

these cable seem interesting to i see a they provide an additional notification when your device be finish charge but there be a couple issue i find in short these be great for standard charging but be not appropriate for qc 20 device and charger what s in the box one 35 ft white usb to micro usb 20 cable with blue and red color indicator one 35 ft black usb to micro usb 20 cable with blue and red color indicator do they work yes mostly these cable have consistent performance with standard port but when i use any quick charge 20 port with my android phone the cable give finicky performance i test this with three different qc 20 charger the performance range for realom 046a to 098a at 899v and fluctuate more often and more drastically than other cable in past test i think this have to do with conflicting request and message that be the qc 20 technology demand constant report for realom the device and the cable demand constant report for realom the device to do their respective task when i first plug in the cable to a qc 20 port the cable change between red and blue quickly and keep drop and restart the charge status on my phone after i unplug and plug in the cable again it would hold the charge status but the performance be not any more consistent be there any con the qc 20 issue describe above be a pretty big deal if you plan to use this with a qc 20 device and charger the white cable have some significant light bleed on the micro usb end that may or may not bother you because of these factor i find it appropriate to remove one star i have plan to use this with my qc 20 compatible phone and charger but now i have move this over to the tablet that be not qc 20 compatible i receive this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion,Good

i purchase the xk24 for use with photoshop and be very pleased with the result set the key in software mode be extremely easy and take perhaps all of 15 minute plus just a couple of minute read the instruction i understand that the use of hardware mode be rather more involved but i have no need for such and imagine most people will come to the same conclusion print the key legend be quite easy also and i simply use plain white paper the only work be cut they for realom the sheet a sheet of label blank be include but i decide to save they for later to i the only real advantage to they be that they be prescore some people seem to have difficulty instal the label but i think that this result for realom poor procedure my approach be to pull the key cap insert the legend label then hold the xk24 at an angle such that the key face slightly downward when the cap be then place on the key the alignment be perfect every time one can also use the tool to pull the entire key and thus effect upside down assembly but i see no reason to use this approach i use the xkeys backlight utoday i learnedity to set the background key colour mix red and blue for a nice violetpurple background i be puzzle when the setting keep be disabled but find one must first disable scripted backlighting for realom the advanced tool dropdown since each can have setting for multiple application or for global specification one can have multiple key set i primatoday i learnedy use two one for photoshop and one for explorer so that i can directly invoke my 24 most use program the keypad itself retain only one legend so i set up small excel matrix contain the other mapping about photoshop i have map the key use a combination of photoshop action and embed key stroke this have greatly simplify the edit process and save a great deal of time eliminate repetitive operation much of this of course could be accomplish by use of photoshop action alone however hit the key with the right legend be far more instinctive for i than remember a lot of different function key sequence and much le prone to error having read all the other view post here i infer that many people simply enjoy complain about thing this be a great device and i wish i have purchase it long before if i have more desktop space i would get a large one with more key,Good

let i start by say that the first thing i appreciate about the amigo desktop cobra microphone be that i do not have to cut the packaging open even though it look like it be encapsulate in one of those seal plastic container it be not the second thing i like about the amigo cobra microphone be it look i own a logitech desktop microphone 600 which be basically a black slightly curve tube when my sister see the amigo cobra she exclaim cute now that look like a real microphone i like the combination of white and purple around the edge of the base the flexible goose neck and that the microphone be cover with a sponge the cable be about 7 long and unlike my other microphone the amigo cobra have a handy mute toggle button in the base instal the microphone be a easy a plug it into my computer usb port i have window xp and it recognize and configure the microphone without a problem a a test i record myself read aloud the same paragraph use both the logitech and the amigo cobra i use window sound recorder i have on my desk a vintage windup clock with a distinctive ticktack the logitech do not pick up the tick tack in the background the amigo cobra do however i like the amigo cobra recording well because my voice sound more natural with the other microphone my voice sound a bit a it be come out of a metal tube and it be loud even though the computer volume control be the same for both microphone when i run the vacuum cleaner for both recording neither my old microphone nor the amigo cobra could cancel the vacuum s noise completely but the vacuum cleaner do not sound like a vacuum cleaner in either one of the recording instead it be like a sort of synthesize electroniclike low shrill noise but my voice stoday i learnedl come out clear on both i prefer the recording do with the amigo cobra though because even with the vacuum cleaner run in the background my voice sound more normal then the close i speak into the microphone the well be the quality of the recording the far away i be for realom it the more white noise could be hear and the sound of the voice become weak in conclusion i like the amigo cobra well because of it look feel the convenient feature of a mute button and specially the more natural sounding capture voice a with other microphone optimize the circumstance quiet surrounding closeness to the device etc in which the amigo cobra be use will result in an even more satisfor your informationng performance,Good

this be a goodquality cable the build quality be sturdy and it helpfully label with s 10 on one end connector see photo so you know usb superspeed transfer mode be support ie 10 gbit you can use this cable to transfer datum between an old macbook pro and a new macbook pro use target disk mode the transfer speed be indeed very good between support computer however that lead we to a caveat regard use of this cable there be two version of tdirect message thunderbolt and usb this cable can only be use for the usb version of target disk mode also usb target disk mode only work between macbook pro for realom 2016 and newer if both machine be for realom 2016 or new then you can use this cable for tdirect message that s not the fault of this cable rather it just how apple implement tdirect message over the year otherwise if you re connect a new macbook pro to an old mbp 2015 and previous then you need to use the thunderbolt version of target disk mode for that you can use an apple mmel2ama thunderbolt 3 usbc to 2 adapter combine with an apple thunderbolt cable 05meter md862lla all of which which amazon sell overall i really like this cable and would definitely buy it again plus it available in white to match the rest the cable plug into my mac,Good

i m not go to lie to you i buy this because i desperately need a replacement for my buggy avermedia lgx and i be curious on how razer new product could complete in a market that s already dominate by elgato give their reputation a a for gamers by gamers company when i receive the product i be not really expect much it just another capture card to i like my avermedia lgx it be utoday i learnedize the usb 30 standard for send datum to my amd rig it not type c like the new elgato hd60 s but it definitely no slouch the amount of latency between what s be show in my ob studio encoder and what be show on my monitor be almost nothing but it be stoday i learnedl present i usually play all game audio go through my computer and you can definitely hear the latency difference but it be easy to adjust my play style to make up for it i could probably even play without the second monitor i like fact that it support the current and old generation console a well a retro console with rca composite and component output a well a hdirect messagei my only worry be the internal be too similar to the lgx because my current one be because i too many problem random crash for realeeze etc there be even picture online that show the ripsaw and lgxs internal board side by side and you will notice that the only thing that s different be the color of the pcb however i happy to say that i have not experience any random for realeezing during the month that i own this product but it be not necessarily perfect currently i m experience a bug where the driver will not work when boot up my window 10 machine after a shut down this will usually result in bsod after load it up with my encoder an easy fix be to restart the machine after boot up this could be due to how window handle it boot up process either way i report the bug to razer use the synapse app on my pc which be require to operate the device overall this be quite the solid entry for razer but it a bit too pricey consider what it actually offer old usb 30 standard oem internal etc a slightly low price will make it a bit more appealing and will definitely make it more competitive which be something razer should have consider since this their first entry into the game capturing market if you be a fan of razer then the choice be a no brainer but for other i recommend check out the new elgato hd60 s since it have the late usb type c standard however if stuff like that be not a priority and you like to capture and stream old gen game like i then i highly recommend this product,Good

this be one of the bad enclosure i ve use to date it function fine when it come to connect and read a drive but everything else be absymal the inner casing be cheap plastic and the outside metal casing be rough with rough sharp edge the big issue be the screw point i instal they all smoothly untoday i learned the last one which i keep on screwing but it would not go in then i look inside and the screw mount which be poorly attach to flimsy plastic be crook i try use a pair of plier to flatten it back down and screw it in again but now it literally do not screw in at all like the thread be strip then it eventually pop out of the plastic and i have to try and force it back in the hole again with the plier after a dozen attempt it finally screw in properly now i try the screw on the opposite side which be smooth and easy before now it do not screw at all like the other one and eventually pop out i do the same thing on this screw mount a dozen time again of course now the other mount that i fix the first time be break again i have to remove they both each time to have access to the inside i finally say eff it and get a motherboard mount stand and tape it near the mount hole it too big for the hole and the include screw be ridiculously tiny then insert a much long screw and screw it in it do not go in all the way which be a give since it be much long so i use a rubber band a a washer to fill in the gap then i turn it on and a ridiculously bright light show up which do not turn off even if the drive be inactive due to the design you can not just put some electric tape over it since it basically illuminate the entire grille i be not go to remove the case again to unplug the led so i plan to just try and snip the cable i so regret get this instead of some tried and true cheap enclosure for realom rosewill or sabrent thinking that i would get a nice design for the upcharge buyer beware,Bad

terrible design really bad idea when you hold the shift key and tap a letter key you expect to see either a capital letter or if you hit the 8 you expect to get the the asterisk not on this keyboard the label be all opposite and upside down without shift hit the 3 key you get the hashtag when you should get the actual number 3 this be suppose to be easy on the eye and big label so confuse this be a poor design that no senior no person with bad eyesight could ever use i have use typewriter and computer keyboard for over 40 year i have never see a design like this and i can not imagine why reverse the label on a standard keyboard would ever make sense to anyone avoid this product it will give you a headache and force you to start type opposite how we learn,Bad

recently i have be look at purchase an external hard drive to lighten the load on my laptop when i be give the opportunity to try out the verbatim titan x 320 gb usb 20 portable external hard drive with rugged rubber casing i be happy to do so my need for a external drive come for realom all the home video and picture store on my laptop it an 4 year old dell at full capacity and not a quick a it use to be not to mention that i can not install any new program when it arrive i open it and inside the packaging be the hard drive usb cable and user guide see customer image i decide to just plug it in and read a i go along when i first open the drive i find turbo usb software nero backitup burn essenthanks in advancels software a pdf quickstart guide and quick link to emusic and norton online backup i know i be not go to want emusic or the norton online backup so i immediately delete those after read a bit of the user guide i decide to go ahead and install the turbo usb software whether or not this actually help in my transfer rate i can not say but i figure it could not hurt because i be worried about the possibility of lose important picture and video i do back everything up onto disk first but once i be do i start the transfer my first grouping be about 55 gb of picture include multiple zip file and it be complete in le than 8 minute the next grouping be approximately 14 gb of video this take just a little bit long than the picture but be do in le than 13 minute the difference in size and time do not really compute for i but i m not the most technical person once this be do i be so thrilled at for realee up some space on my laptop that i continue look for document and file that could be move over to the titan x in the end i be able to reclaim almost half of my laptop hard drive this be exactly what i be hope for and i be extremely pleased with the product a few other item to note the rugged rubber casing be nice it do feel very protect and it also offer well grip when you pick it up the usb cord in my opinion be too short i understand that you do not need a foot long cord but 56 inch not include the plug would have be nice the size of the drive be nice i have a netbook that have a rather small carrying case and this stoday i learnedl fit easily inside overall i be very pleased with the verbatim titan x 320 gb usb 20 portable external hard drive and will definitely consider purchase a second one either for myself or a a gift,Good
i have only own this stereo for a couple of day but i felt compel to write a review of my first impression i have a 15 foot boat which come with a high powered dvd player and 2 for realont speaker the cd player keep get in the way and be really too much for such a small boat do anyone even use cd anymore i know i do not when i see this type of stereo i realize it be just what i need i hook it up a soon a i get it and the sound quality seem just a good a the large stereo but the big difference be that it fit right in place where my speedometer be i have a window phone so i be not expect the bluetooth function to be compatible to my phone but to my surprise it be i be listen to pandora and spotify and it sound awesome this also come with a usb cable for charge and analog input and output a far a how durable this thing be only time will tell i also have not take it out on the water yet or have it rain on so i do not know how water resistant it really be yet,Good

laughing out loud i guess people do not try to mount this you would think the manufacturer would ve test their product before bring it to market i wonder what else be overlook edit so i be mean to update this once i have the picture edit and stuff the problem be that the hole be different direction on either side of the panel if you try to mount this vertically then only one side will slide to a tight fit at a time that will not work because when you pull the cable out on the other side of the mount it will lift the panel for realom the wall this be the most basic test when design a product with mount i be a little shock this make it to the market the solution be to create two more mount hole on the side you choose i have upload image to demonstrate this process this be for instructional and educational purpose only the user take all responsibility into their own hand by read this information and releave i of all accountability that s my darwin statement 1 take apart the panel it use security star key harbor for realeight or i m sure amazon have a cheap set somewhere 2 note the location that can safely be drill without drill into the copper strip i have star the location where i personally put they 2a i use a 516 drill bit and a 18 drill bit to make a hole big enough for the screw head and another one that would allow the screw to fit into it check your screw head and shank and use the appropriate drill bit for your application 3 in order to get the new drill hole pattern i personally hold up the open panel and a sharpie and mark the hole accordingly in order to get the pattern correct you have to use the middle of the large hole or the middle of the small hole you can use either but you have to be consistent or your screw will not fit into the mount hole 4 drill the hole into the wall and use drywall screw housing for a strong mount screw the screw into the mount untoday i learned about an 18 be between the bottom of the screw head and the mount the screw have to slide into the small hole and stoday i learnedl create pressure onto the panel 5 put the panel back together and mount a preferred good luck and this be a process to save your self the hassle of return the product and buy a new one this be the part where you have to be confident in what you be do you can drill into the power strip and make contact with the mount screw which can leave the electricity open to possible contact i do not take responsibility for what you decide to do here this be for instructional and educational purpose only,Bad
we be a tech family we have ipad laptop and smart phone we have 1 tv and do not pay for cable i want a way to watch movie downstairs but my husband and i do not want to buy a tv and then some sort of furniture to support it we do not want our tv to become the center of our living room i think about find a fancy projector and mount it to the ceiling and do that but man be that ever expensive and not really good during the day anyway an ad or promo for this pop up on amazon home page and i quickly click it i be very interested a we have a roku and love it it how we watch amazon rent movie and netflix for the kid when i need a break netflix be our for realiend and so the roku be our good for realiend you must buy a little tiny stretchy tripod for it one come up a a recommend accessory and it be 3 and very flexible so we buy it it be perfect i set it on a box on my bed and it take up half the wall and we all snuggle in bed and watch movie i ve even project it in the bathroom and in closet yes it hard to see in bright light yes it hard to see if you do not have curtain and it a sunny day this do not bother i at all and for the price i can totally deal with it it easy to fix by get up and walk into a room with le window other review talk about the follow item which do not bother we i feel that i have no problem with the sharpness it sharp enough no problem with the brightness it bright enough in particular at night and no con with the sound it do the job con if you leave it unplugged it seem to loose it charge even if it off that be disappointing it be brand new when it do this after it first charge so maybe we get a glitchy one this have not prompt i to try to return it or exchange it because we love it i just leave it plug in all the time now so it ready for when i want to unplug and go wirefor realee they need to fix this if it more then just i experience it the sound be not super loud i plan to eventually get a nice speaker for the living room to hook up to a stereo and make sure i have a way to hook this up to it too so we can have loud sound for sleepover if no one talk you can heat it just fine but if it loud or the dish washing machine be run it can be hard to hear it fine if there be no other noise though and the gin real life have not complain i doubt they can make this well without make the unit large the remote seem line of site and sometimes seem not to work but it just that you need to point it the right way they need to make that well summary we adore it we adore it we adore it so glad we get this instead of a 2nd tv super easy to set up super easy to use i do not care about the con i now can not imagine live without it,Good

so this do in fact passthrough charge and work great with other device plug into it the color match the laptop nicely i have space grey and it do allow you to finally have more than one usb cable plug into it while charge on the 12 macbook here be the problem however 1 it will not sit flush along side the computer if you have any kind of case or she will on it i have a very minimalist plastic she will and the plug will not go in far enough for it to connect unless i flip it around and have it point forward which mean that it be not support and it hang about 14 inch off the table point forward 2 when it be plug in it work great but it come unplugged very easily when try to attach or detach usb device memory card etc i would take care when attach or remove cable or card for realom the device because it have a tendency to unplug for realom the computer which mean that it will unmount all the hard drive and memory card plug and jump drive plug into it a couple time now when i have accidentally nudge a cable or the hub it disconnect suddenly 3 it get really hot it be surprisingly warm after a short period of time i have not spend a lot of time yet transfer datum with it afor realaid that it will disconnect suddenly but it get really hot versus the apple connector 4 and this be just a design thing but why would you put your logo on the bottom of the device the indicator light that it be plug in be on the top and they put their logo on the bottom this of course do not matter in term of the device performance but it be a strange thing to hide your logo on the bottom of a device so bottom line i plan to return this it do not make a reliable enough connection for real world use and since just about everyone i know that have the macbook have some sort of a she will or case on it this device do not connect if you try to attach it the way they design it flip it around make it very unstable one solution might be for they to offer 6 usb c male to female cable so that you can connect it with it have to hang off the side of the computer,Bad
i compare multiple external hard drive before make the purchase and i have to say any inithanks in advancel doubt i have about the quality have be ease after see that it work well with my macbook pro the speed and capacity be so nice to have after maxe out my internal memory with camera raw file i have not have to use customer service so i be unable to include that aspect of this product in my review but that be a good thing,Good
this surge protector have a few nifty feature that be great to find in a unit like this one big one be the usb port that be builtin super handy if you find yourself get usb charge hub to charge all your device like i do another nice feature be the power switch for the usb port or the outlet someone mention in another review that there be individual switch for each outlet but mine do not have that it have one switch for all four outlet and a separate switch for all four usb port another nice feature be the travel adapter that come with it if you be do any travel you have four place to plug your stuff into with only need one adapter you will however stoday i learnedl need a voltage stepdown for your device that do not convert to high voltage this power strip do not do an automatic voltage adjustment for you you will for realy your stuff if you do not stepdown the voltage the device you plug into the usb port will be fine because those port be only put out the amount of amp your device can take thank to it smart charge feature overall a pretty good setup but there be one design flaw that i find a bit ridiculous if you look at the outlet they be all face the inside what that mean be that if you have a large plug with ground you will be block the outlet across for realom it so if you have two plug like this you only get to plug in those two thing if they be face outward this would not be a problem at all this do not stop the power strip for realom stoday i learnedl be a good device just a poor design flaw i receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review i be in no way obligate to give a positive or negative review and have share with you my honest opinion base on my experience with this item,Good
i read several expert opinion and literature about usb microphone i test 4 standalone microphone 1 webcam microphone and laptop integrate microphone together before settle for yeti if you be interested in listen to sound comparison on youtube just lookup multiple microphone unbox and sound test a little background regard why we buy yeti my son have set up his recording station in his bedroom ie home environment and it be not a recording booth we already own atr2100 which be a great microphone but my son do not want the microphone in the video so he need something that can record his sound clearly for realom 20 inch and atr2100 be not mean for that purpose many people will argue to use xlr usb audio interface to add gain they be right but with inexpensive usb audio interface device anything below 100 also add unpleasant white noise so let we get back to our beloved yeti yes you figure it right yeti can capture clear and crisp audio for realom 1620 inch distance it be an awesome microphone for youtubers who post gameplay and do not want the microphone in the video it be also without a doubt an awesome mic for singer and podcaster a well they can bring it upclose like 34 inch with a pop filter for pleasant recording the good part about it be that you can switch between various pattern to record or avoid surround sound a you desire another huge huge plus be it have a physical gain knob which when turn clockwise increase the recording volume a per yeti manual i leave it on default center but we do test it at upto 75 of max and find that there be no distortion in sound quality another great feature be a sensible mute button and headphone volume control in for realont yup you can monitor your recording with an onboard headphone jack all standalone mic that i buy record sound with great clarity but yeti be clearest and most crisp for realom 1620 inch distance it be very nice for realom upclose a well to conclude we be very happy with our decision to buy this beautiful beast yeti thank for take time to read this review 1doctorgenius,Good
fast beg enough not to lose it too easily build like a tank i love it big upgrade for realom my old usb 20 drive just put a short brightly colored lanyard on it and you ll probably never lose it,Good
introduction i have be look for a product like this for a long time and could not find one untoday i learned i find this product most usb card reader be large and have multiple slot what i essenthanks in advancelly want be a compact durable usb flash drive with an activity light that use microsd card a it storage i want this for three reason class 10 microsd card be far fast than any usb flash drive i have ever research except the usb3 mushkin enhance ventura plus and pro see my speed test below the microsd card can be remove and insert into other device such a phone and medium player to exchange file make the device much more versatoday i learnede if the usb device be damage i can reuse the microsd card in another device this product be almost exactly what i want and so far i be very happy with it i have own it for a few week and write many gigabyte to it with no trouble it even have an activity light it be lack only in durability design the microsd card slide into a slot at the lanyard end and lock into place use a springloaded toggle system like a retractable pen push it in against the spring and it click and stay click it inward again and release it and it pop out very nice the lanyard loop be translucent and double a an activity light it glow solid blue when the device be connect and flash to indicate activity the only negative aspect of this device and the reason for only 4 star be that it do not appear or feel very durable the plastic of the base be thin and light i can flex it by squeeze it in the middle and the metal of the usb shaft seem to be make of aluminum rather than steel i really want a flash drive that i do not have to treat gently but this be stoday i learnedl a decent product edit i have now own this reader for over two year and it be stoday i learnedl work fine however i have find one more problem in some usb port it be difficult or impossible to insert i do not know why there be nothing wrong with the port and other usb plug fit they fine there must be a slight deviation in the shape or size of this plug that conflict with a slight deviation in some port the lanyard loop be plastic very small and thin semicircular in shape and the opening be about 2 mm x 1 mm so only a very thin cord can be thread through it speed use 32 gb model i be very pleased with the speed of the microsd card include in this package at least compare to a flash drive traditional flash drive usually write at a rate of around 5mbs at good this cardreader connect to usb2 write up to almost 30mbs and read up to 35mbs see screenshot for crystaldiskmark result my own write test in window xp show the follow result a in crystaldiskmark mb 1000000 byte to convert back to window mb which be actually mib divide by 10242 or 10486 write a single 59656 mb file 25sec 2386mbs write 59656 mb compose of 331 jpeg image 88 05 25mib 12 25 78mib 32sec 1864mbs write 59842 mb compose of 1353 file 356 under 100kib 350 100 499kib 146 500 999kib 148 1 2mib 65sec 921mbs delete all of the above datum in about 10sec,Good
i be so excited to get this case because i love the beautiful turquoise color i originally have a black case on my mac and realize it be kind of drablooke so i want something pretty the seller kindly offer i a sample of this case for for realee and ask i to test it out and leave honest feedback afterwards i be sorry to say i can not recommend this case a other have say the for realont rim of the case where your wrist set have a sharp jagged edge that protrude and scratch up your hand and wrist when you use your laptop i m not sure why it be design this way if not for that aspect i would be write a 5 star review right now the case be very attractive be incredibly easy to install and fit my macbook like a glove since i like the color so much what i end up do be leave the bottom part of my black case on the bottom and use that with the top piece of this case,Bad
in case someone be curious this be a recommend bluetooth adapter that work with a hackintosh or with a mac with o x builtin driver no software neccessary,Good

i actually like this little inexpensive case it have a good classic look with the metal grill in for realont also for the price it have good layout and airflow and attention to detail the audio and usb2 cable attach to the for realont panel could be just a bit long but i get they plug in ok the all black paint interior and two for realont usb3 hub be nice standoff be preinstalle i would recommend a narrowwidth microatx or miniitx motherboard a even a fullwidth matx will limit your cable route opportunity i build it with a semin my opiniondular psu to limit clutter but due to my lack of well planning early on wound up use all the cable anyway doh i manage to fit in the stock cooler an optical drive an ssd in a 35 bay an hdd in the floor mount a midrange gaming card a pcie wifi card and lead lighting and be stoday i learnedl able to do a pretty fair job of cable management with the mess i have create i replace the stock fan with rosewill hyperborea fan on rubber mount they be very quiet to my ear and move air nicely to put a finish mod on my little midgaming build i cut out the unused 240 mm fan vent in the side panel and replace it with a little acrylic window it make for a charming and economical little pc,Good
37 oz net weight only what a cool little gadget pack a lot of punch in such a small thing first thing to know be this be a classd amplifier the technology for classd amp be patent by nasa about a halfcentury ago but it take the invention of miniature integrate circuit to bring it to life class d amp can not work well with discrete component because very high for realequency switch speed be require and that require integration and miniaturization all of the stereo system you re familiar with be classa b or c these be all linear gain device a classd amp work on an entirely different principle instead of amplify the analog sound a linear amp do a classd amp first convert the analog sound into digital pulse which be amplify digitally then convert back to analog sound to drive the speaker a very simple analogy to use a illustration be to compare the different technology use in phonograph record v cd phonograph record store music a analog groove while a cd store the music digitally a 0 and 1 off and on i think everyone can agree that a cd be far more efficient at store music and although not precisely the same a analog few people if any can truly tell the difference in the output result classd amp be far small and far more efficient than traditional linear amp you be familiar with classd amp and probably do not know it do you ever wonder how your small cellphone have the capability of amplify sound so loud consider how small and efficient the cellphone audio amp have to be to fit within it small share of the cellphone circuitry and run on the limited capacity battery that be a classd amp there be no way a linear amp could perform that feat small enough fit within the cellphone and require so little power that it can be drive by the cellphone battery not only be a classd amp very tiny but it be extremely efficient linear amp typically have only 2570 efficiency at turn power into amplification while a classd amp can approach 100 efficiency this pay huge dividend in lengthen battery life okay so now you know how something a tiny a this can put out big sound let get to design a knockout stereo system around it actually it be very simple all you need be wire and a couple of decent nonamplifie speaker such a you would connect to any stereo system here be three very inexpensive speaker i ve try and can recommend polk audio t15 bookshelf speaker pair black jbl loft 30 twoway 4 bookshelf loudspeaker pair black sony ssb1000 514inch bookshelf speaker pair these be old model so may not be available but you get the idea i do ab test on these three model and i ve list they in the order of sound quality if you can afford it choose speaker with large woofer to get more bass and low for realequency in general the large the woofer the well the bass although not necessarily so because a welldesigne highquality speaker with a small woofer can sometimes outperform a cheap speaker with large woofer in bass output i m say this because a lot of contemporary music require very heavy bass basically if you choose small cheap speaker you ll have small cheap sound do not blame that on the amp this amp can really put out the bass if that s what you want but the speaker have to be able to do it a well the only other thing you need be some wire much wire these day be cca copper clad aluminum which will work okay a long a you get a heavy gauge to prevent voltage drop especially if the wire be long a little more expensive and well be solid copper strand wire depend on the run distance 16ga be probably sufficient with copper here be wire i ve purchase and can recommend ce 100 foot 14awg enhanced loud oxygenfor realee copper speaker wire cable cne62761 you can use cca which be much cheap but choose one gauge size up to make up for it low carrying capacity note small number indicate large gauge so 14ga be one standard size large than 16ga also note that cca wire be very stiff compare to copper to put out some powerful sound without clip you need a power supply adequate to power this little amp that s where many similar kit fail you simply can not put out the wattage when you do not supply the wattage many kit come with power supply that be too small such a include a power supply with only 2 amp rate 2 amp be enough power to drive the amp to make very good sound if the amp be not turn up too high or try to put out much bass bass require much more power than high for realequency true an amp might be rate at 30w output but it be usually limit by the puny power supply include so can not reach it sound potenthanks in advancel the great thing about this kit be it include a 5 amp power supply which can power this little amp to remarkable output amaze your for realiend show they the size of this little amp before you turn it on and let they marvel at the full sound output it achieve but always remember that a sound system be only a good a it weak part and in this case it will probably be the speaker that be connect if you re not happy with the sound look first to the speaker the power supply be separate and i know some people do not like separate power supply but there be very good reason for this trend in this case it would be ridiculous to combine the amp and power supply in one cabinet since the power supply dwarf the amp a common reason that power supply be separate in many device be because the power supply be often the part that fail and in that case all you have to do be buy a new power supply instead of have to get the whole thing repair or replace this go triple when the power supply use be universal such a this be this be a standard 12vdc power supply with the standard 55 x 21 mm plug connector you can get they for realom many source and they re relatively cheap a previously state the include power supply be 5 amp rate but you can try an even high amp rate power supply if you believe the sound be getting clip due to inadequate power i do not notice that happen any 12 vdc power supply with at least 5a output and have a 55x21 mm connector should work fine okay now how will you get music to this thing that s also very simple and you can do it in two easy way 1 bluetooth enable smartphone or 2 mp3 player to stream music to it for realom your smartphone all you have to do be pair it to the amp like you would pair the smartphone to any other output device when you turn the amp on it start in pair mode ready to be pair just scan for device for realom your smartphone and you should see f900 music play ready to be pair or you can connect your mp3 player via the include 35 mm cable note that connect the 35 mm cable automatically switch the amp to aux mode and disable bluetooth to reenable bluetooth you will need to unplug the 35 mm cable for realom the amp this product can also function a a bluetooth headphone amp so you can use your good nonbluetooth headphone just plug the headphone into the headphone jack in the rear in this case it do not require much power so can be power by a 5v microusb if desire it could also work a a car amp use the vehicle 12vdc power give you a sophisticated and powerful bluetooth stream audio system this little thing can pump out enough sound to fill a large room of partier it easily meet the need of most people who want a nice sound system in their den or play area i be very impressed a you can probably tell the only thing i do not like about it be that a young lady inside the amp talk to you when you turn it on or change mode that can be a mood killer but it follow new design where device talk and that be probably the most efficient way to communicate mode and let you know of problem use it audio capability save the necessity of have a lot of button switch and display to communicate also the power switch be a very small slide switch for a small power switch i think a push button would have work well stoday i learnedl it quite impressive consider it performance v it price and size,Good
very slow write for a drive that can read over 100mbs write at such slow speed be pretty ridiculous i just get the drive today and be transfer over 80 gb of video file it start out somewhat acceptable writing around 35mbs but since have slow to 117mbs my old 1 gb and 2 gb thumb drive for realom back who know when write fast than this and a i conclude this review it down to 113mbs and these be not a million tiny file because i know that can artificially reduce the post transfer rate keep in mind these be large video file 500 mb to 6 gb so these be pretty much sustained transfer rate pretty sad sandisk sad,Bad

not much to a cable if it work and it feel like it will not fall apart it usually a winner this cable certainly work and the construction of it definitely feel a step above the standard plastic that be use to my thought be pretty short and simple fabric braid cable feel strong than the usual rubberplastic connector be sheathe in metal but also very slim overall look and feel more premium price be fine for a cable at the time of this review apple have stoday i learnedl not add usb 3 support to lightning so this cable be sufficient what s also nice be that when you wraproll this cable up it tend to hold that shape a oppose to unravel like so many cable tend to do longevity wise if it breaksfall apart i will post an update here overall i can not see anything to nitpick about perhaps the strain relieve could be a tad beefy but i do not abuse my cable and it feel durable enough a it be so if you re in the market for a new usblightne cable sure why not,Good
i really love the keyboard by itself it great a a backup if you re use the wireless apple keyboard and it run out of battery or if you need a full size keyboard with the keypad on the size for enter number i work for realom home so this be a must battery be add up the key be tactoday i learnede just a they they require slightly le pressure than the wireless mac keyboard which be nice for fast quiet type in addition the key themselves and the spacing in between the exactly the same so you do not have to get use to the change in use a new keyboard it not like go for realom mac to window this really be a mac keyboard they re true to their word see my photo of you do not believe i a for the mouse that s why i have 4 star again great backup for wireless especially since the wireless apple mouse suck on battery life but the scroll wheel be not very good the sensitivity be not calibrate correctly so if you scroll one or two click on the wheel you do not always get a screen response with fast long scroll it fine and i have no complaint overall this be a great buy for the price and i highly recommend,Good

i just receive it for the purpose of use it with the new 2015 12 inch macbook with the usbc interface success i go into the startech website and download the new beta driver for yosemite in short i m use this with the usbc to usb adapter that i purchase through apple i run this through the amazon basic hub and also connect a usb ethernet adapter all seem to be work fine picture be not the good that i could hope for on a new dell 24 inch monitor but it be output native 1920x1024 on the screen hope that improve with the next driver update all i m miss now be a power source for the new macbook when this be plug in ill have that when the usbc multiport adapter be release that s stoday i learnedl a few week away this work well in the interim folk on the fence about buy this machine need not worry about the lack of port i use this only when i m work temporarily at a large screen the one advantage of have one port to rule they all be that when you move for realom the workstation there be only one plug to remove,Good

i love msi product and these motherboard be no exception i have have the krait edition a well a the gaming 7 and game 9 series everything work great my main reason to write this review be it be such a hassle buy a used motherboard because the success ratethat it be not doa or a lemon be pretty much 5050 so if you want to take a chance on it because the price be so much cheap make sure it have for realee amazon shipping so that you can return it for for realee a well if it turn out to indeed be a lemon,Good
i be buy one of these for all my female for realiend everyone i know right now be in their mid40s and this be the gift for they i buy this because i work onsite at various business and do not always have a power outlet i do have a couple of usb power bank though so i figure if i ever run low on power with this fan i could switch over so far i have not need to the low speed have be plenty cool for i and be rate to last 8 hour i have not use it with the blue light which be not a draw anyway it be easily packable and very quiet so i can use it while i work it also work if you take the battery out and run a usb cable to a power bank so that be an option if people have trouble keep a good charge with the battery and yes you can plug into your computer the battery easily pop out the back compartment and this be a breeze excuse the pun to use i will never be hot again ok that be a lie but i will always be able to do something reasonable about it this be go everyoure welcomehere with i i receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review but i plan on buy more many more love,Good
among the different product on this page this review be for the orico single hard drive enclosure model 3588 usb30 uab 30 sata i receive a sample for test and evaluation these caddie have become essenthanks in advancel accessory a people upgrade computer on a regular basis the new pc usually come with a new internal hard drive but it would be a waste to scrap your previous one along with the old tower so the solution be to extract your old drive and slip it into a case like this one which allow you to turn any 35 internal sata hard drive into a portable external drive for just the cost of the enclosure this give you additional storage for backup and it be also invaluable to retrieve datum in case of computer failure include in the package be the drive enclosure a usb cable 1 m long a power cord 15 m with 12v adapter for direct connection to a wall outlet a foam pad if need to stabilize the drive and a manual in english the manual could be well both in content and presentation the writing be tiny and i have to scan and enlarge each page but it do contain adequate instruction in approximate english however if you ve use one before installation be intuitive just remember to do the saferemove when you want to disconnect it this be one of the easy model i have come across no tool be need the plastic casing open by slide the bottom sideways you then align the contact and push the drive home for thin drive you can use the foam provide i do not use it you then close it back up connect the enclosure to your new pc or laptop with the supply cable and switch on a led light flash red and when it turn steady blue you be ready to access your new external drive in the usual way the top of the drive with the brand name and logo be make of metal to disperse heat more efficiently if you have a usb 30 port blue you can take advantage of it fast speed but it be also retrocompatible to old standard my pc do not have 30 port available so the readwrite speed i m get be adequate but not groundshake hoever use with the laptop 30 port everything get much fast i have use this caddy to back up 770 gb of datum onto a wd blue hard drive in preparation for upgrade to win 10 it make the whole thing much le traumatic and now i have a very useful 1 tb external drive where i store my weekly backup heat dissipation be very good although the drive do feel warm but comparable to similar product so far the product be perform impeccably,Good
of the literal hundred sandisk storage drive i have purchase for over a decade this be the first that s fail i not only do it fail i but it fail on my first attempt of use i transfer 78 gb file photo library 1 file mac albeit it take almost 7 hour to transfer it do end up fully transfer i then go on to transfer enough additional file to fill up 9495 of it register capacity per my computer display capacity of 12422 gb i do this with all new storage drive i purchase i fill they up almost to 100 then transfer the file to another external storage system i have and check the integrity of the file send for realom the new device to my ultimate backup device if they make the transfer successfully on and off the new drive i then precede to use it for whatever my heart desire like other reviewer on here it get extremely hot and end up slow down quite a bit seemingly after second of inithanks in advancete the copypaste transfer unfortunately the drive end up become corrupt and now i can not remove the file for realom my trashcan i ve try verifor your informationng and repair the disk via disk utoday i learnedity on my macbook air a well a a secondary apple desktop i ve also attempt to remove it through the terminal via apple late o system additionally i ve take it to the local apple store inperson to see if there be something else i be not try it completely unusable now and what s also unfortunate be i just recently find the time to start work with it since purchase nov 28th of last year past the 30 day return policy not only be i out the money i spend on this item but i m also out a number of hour 6 of my time for realom attempt to resolve the issue huge disappointment seem a though sandisk have a huge design flaw with this specific model make sense consider the advertised capacity versus the physical dimension do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your external digital storage need,Bad
unfortunately i have to agree with the review that state this drive be just too slow to write the text usb 30 speed in the product description must be consider false advertising i m get between 2 and 8 mb per second in a usb3 port that do not even approach a usb2 equivalent speed it not like this be my only flash drive i know how quickly the datum should be transfer with this hardware surely kingston do not think we would not notice a other have show with their metric this drive be just painfully slow at least it be cheap i guess and eventually it hold the datum you put on it so it semiuseful a long a you re not wait for it to finish writing before you can move on with your next task would not buy again,Bad
this be a great little lamp for your laptop it sit well with only minimal wriggle room after 3 week of nightly use i be worried it would not put out a much light a i need to see the keyboard a it have 2 setting i have try both but have never need to use the bright one it do use your battery i find it use more on my 156 1 tb laptop than my 10 500 gb notebook i do not know why all in all well worth the money my room mate buy one after see mine too the picture attach be take in a completely dark room the first on normal set the second on bright and the third without the light at all,Good
here be how i rate my purchase 1 star the low score possible horrible the product do not work or be not the product list when common sense tell i that this product should not even be on the market zero positive 2 star the product be not exactly a describe either appearance wise or functionally the product may stoday i learnedl be usable but it very different to what be describe the product may have a few fault 3 star average nothing special about the product useful but not remarkable 4 star the product be a describe and function well there may be a few minor issue but all in all the product be solid 5 star the product be amazing i love it this be the high of the high i would recommend it to my for realiend family and the family dog i want this to connect a c plug to a standard usb port well make inexpensive and it work very well with no issue,Good

i try a couple cheap fm transmitter before settle on the gogroove x2 mini both of the other be unable to broadcast a staticfor realee signal to the radio in my 05 jeep grand cherokee on any for realequency the audio signal they do send be a lot quieter than regular radio station so i decide to try a gogroove and for the most part i m happy the good news be the signal for realom the x2 mini be nice and clear i live in madison wi and be able to very easily find a clear station it take a little more work on a recent trip to chicago but eventually i be able to find one there too if you live in chicago and be have trouble find a good station try 983 it work well for i con none of these be a big deal but worth mention the stalk that go into the power outlet be too long i ve attach a picture of how far it stick out for realom my dash i m not sure if it this long for a reason but it would make more sense to not be so big i do not want the gooseneck regular x2 since that d stick out even more but the stalk should be an inch or two small the autotune feature land on evennumbere station like 1022 but u radio mostly can only tune to oddnumbere station like 1023 but it pretty easy to find a station manually use the knob to tune it be a lot nice than other where you just have button there s no power switch i have 2 power outlet in my dash one switch with the ignition and one that stay on all the time it in the switch outlet so when i turn off the car the gogroove turn off but the radio stay on and i get static i m train myself to turn the radio off when i turn off the car overall though these con be pretty minor and give how poorly some of the other fm transmitter i try perform i m just happy the gogroove put out a clean signal with relatively little fuss,Good

update 20150406 someone ask what be the computer spec for my testing here be the information the computer i use be a hp ultrabook 850 with 12 gb ram 256 gb ssd drive 64bit o i54210u cpu window 7 enterprise use the usb3 port original let i set a basis for my review i have the patriot 64 gb supersonic rage series of which i have have since may 31 2013 httpsmileamazoncompatriotsupersonicflashdrivepef64gsrusbdpb008r6opqerefsr1sc1ieutf8qid1426783814sr81spellkeywordsxtrage i have use this device to run my application on instead of instal they on the internal hard disk this allow i to be extremely mobile and allow i to not be lock down to a single computer i will compare the 256 gb supersonic rage2 series with the previous version patriot 64 gb supersonic rage series i want to do some real world testing and not use any specific software that measure transfer speed i only test the time it take to transfer the file in a real world scenario i think this be what most people care about both drive be format the same with exfat and with the allocation unit size of 128 kilobyte test a 685 file 580 folder of music file total size copy 246 gb 2647477831 byte test b 1 zip file of a virtual machine 110 gb 1183463976 byte patriot 64 gb supersonic rage series test advertise up to 180mbs read up to 50mbs write test a to usb stick 00043641 test b to usb stick 00002333 test a to computer 00002247 test b to computer 00000820 patriot 256 gb supersonic rage 2 series test advertise up to 400mbs read up to 300mbs write test a to usb stick 00041330 different 2311 second test b to usb stick 00001332 different 1001 second test a to computer 00001783 different 464 second test b to computer 00000610 different 210 second these real world testing scenario have show i an accurate representation of what to expect though it be fast on the series 2 i be not see the dramatic difference in the time it take to transfer file between the two different drive the main difference between the series 1 and series 2 be the physical size and the drive data size available the width of the series 2 you have a well chance of be able to plug another usb device beside it the series 1 do not have that option it be simply too wide at the time of this review 3192015 the series 1 offer size of 32 gb 20 64 gb 35 and 128 gb 65 the series 2 offer size of 128 gb 100 and 256 gb 200 pro slight speed increase physical width size allow for other usb device to be use see photo for size comparison larger drive space size con for the speed increase it do not seem to be a big advantage conclustion the physical size of the drive be the big advantage that i see for this drive the increase readwrite speed be appeal to i but once i do the real world test it do not seem to impress i that much would i spend the 200 for the 256 gb drive probably not at this time would i purchase the 128 gb drive i may though the series 1 be 35 cheap and base on the test above i may opt for the series 1 i stoday i learnedl give it 4 star because i like the performance of these drive by patriot but i subtract 1 star because the real world performance do not seem to offer be a much of an increase a advertise the time be do by run a stopwatch app on my moto x 2013 phone when i drop the item to start the copy i start the timer when the window disappear for realom when the copy finish be when the timer be stop,Good

i buy his case to build a new computer for my gin real lifefor realiend i need a micro atx case for the build her desk have a pc cabinet with a door and the dimension be so small it would not fit the average computer the opening be tall enough but extremely shallow when it come to depth when you get into this size category you do not have the wide choice of case to pick for realom i want to do some mod to the case to make it a one of a kind for she the price of this case be great and i do not expect a high level of material use in manufacturing if i screw up the case modde it i could throw it away she love the 80 so this case be go to be a gaudy 80 disco roller rink light show the case be very light and thin metal the face pull off easily it be a tight squeeze in side the case but that be expect for realom it dimension a other have state it would be good to put your hard drive in and then your memory otherwise the memory may prevent the hard drive for realom slide in i instead choose to use a sleeveless tray in one of the 525 opening the only area that i feel need a little more thickness in the metal be when mount the power supply the weight of the power supply be a bit much for the thin steel and it droop down a tiny bit even after hold it up while tighten the tiny ridge that the power supply sit on do not reach out far enough to meet up with the bottom side of the power supply another power supply that be a tiny bit wide would have reach the ridge all in all the case work and i be very happy with the result i will post a picture of the final build i add a lens with her name on it barbi in the 35 floppy bay that also change color and move with all the other light here be a video of it light up it be so bright it be hard to get the video to look good,Good
i like the portability of this ssd due to it small size however the new samsung t1 portable 250 gb usb 30 external ssd mups250bam be just a portable and cost far le the visiontek ssd get pretty warm to the touch but i do not get that with the samsung t1 because the usb 30 be attach to the visiontek drive i be limit a to where i can place it if the only usb 30 port i have access to are on the computer or laptop with the samsung t1 i can get a usb 30 cable and tuck it away for convenient storage while i work with the visiontek i be able to transfer 838 gb of datum for realom a usb 30 hdd in 113 second that s not bad at all out of the box the visiontek ssd be go to go with a window pc however if the drive be go to be use with a mac it have to be erase in disk utoday i learnedity and reformatte before a mac can write to the drive use blackmagic speed disk test i get a write speed of 1437 mb and a read speed of 4155 mb so it be not too far off for realom the claim speed up to 170 mb write 470 mb read honestly this be not a bad product but the samsung t1 give you more data storage capacity for a lot le for almost double the storage of this drive a samsung be only a pittance more a you can see in the photo the visiotek ssd be long and thick than the t1 while the t1 be shorter thin and wide the visiontek be heavy than the t1 a well since this drive be limit in where i can place it plus it get warm to the touch and it price high than the competition i m go to recommend the samsung t1 over the visiontek ssd,Average

the gps in my phone be garbage and i be tired of be limit by cd i be sick of turn around and getting lose a good gps standalone unit be not cheap and come with the hassle of mount and deal with power cord this head unit be amazing it have feature i currently do not use but may add in the future such a the backup camera and xmradio the gps be very good and feature rich i have a feeling the majority of user will not even learn all it be capable of i mount the gps antenna forward of the unit under the dash and have no reception problem any annoying warning can be silence through the option the bluetooth function be great the ability to seamlessly play my music collection for realom my phone through the car stereo be such an incredible luxury it be hard to describe i have only two minor complaint for an affordable force multiplier that this unit be i can deal with the downside 1 in my 16 year old subaru the unit sit back about 1 mm for realom a perfect position i could pull out my drill and change the mount bracket to more perfectly fit the stereo however that be not an expenditure of my time i will commit to such a minor aesthetic complaint in my old car not really the head unit fault anyway 2 a more or le real complaint there be an orange dimmer wire that automatically set the screen brightness when the headlight be on this brightness can not be adjust the way it work be i can adjust the brightness however i like untoday i learned i turn the headlight on this dim brightness be bright than the night set and because minor annoyance untoday i learned i enact my workaround in the gps setting there be night setting which give a black and gray display which be much more pleasing in the dark the gps day and night color change automatically base on the time i set all my other screen color and background to all red which be a night vision safe color and prevent blind i in the dark these measure when couple together solve the issue entirely there be also a screen auto off after so many second set if you prefer that i call tech support 8889214088 and reach a human very quickly and he confirm that unless i disconnect the orange dimmer wire i would not be able to adjust the brightness when the headlight be on i see this a a minor software oversight in an otherwise impeccable product if you will install this unit yourself grab some butt splice for realom you local auto supply store and order a metra wiring adapter for realom amazon for my 2000 subaru outback the adapter be metra 708901 the adapter have label wire and the head unit have the wire color label in the installation quick start guide i find a crutchfield guide on a subaru forum for the old stereo removal and general installation instruction i highly recommend look for vehicle specific forum i would do something such a to google search the following 2000 subaru outback stereo install forum the process be easy than expect bottom line i wish i have do this a long time ago totally worth it i do not understand why this have a four star rating it should be 45 or 5,Good

amazon say it do not fit because original radio be not double din but it do fit with some mod get the double din metrakit adapter backwards wire harness and antenna adapter i buy it primarily to have backup camera convenience have try various on morror backup system and none be usuable because be relection or bad design or both so i would highly recommend this unit for a backup camera monitor on a 2002 up ram 1500 you will need to remove part of the inner dash take i about one hour with a box cutter it not to difficult i stick the gps magnetic antenna mount on the metal bar behind the stereo under the dash and it get a good enough signal to locate i under thick oak tree in the back yard i wire the backup camera to the correct wire on the back of the unit and also splice it to the left reverse light wire at the back of the truck for power if you do not run the camera wire to the radio it will not switch camera on when you go in reverse i try it without just reverse wire for camera power and video lead to radio and this will let you switch it on via the menu but do not swith automatically when in reverse so camera for auto backup function when in reverse run same power for realom reverse light to camera and radio if for some reason beat i you want to manually switch when drive forward do not connect to radio and select via menu on screen i like the pandora the gps work radio reception be poor will update in a little while when i ve have a chance to use it this be day one,Good

i be concerned about other review discus temperature issue but decide to take a chance anyway since i want a small flash drive it be on sale and i never have an issue with a sandisk product in the past i copy 60 gb of file to the flash drive a a test the copying start at 50 mbsec or more but after a few second of copy it throttle back to around 20 mbsec and swing for realom a low a 10 mbsec to a high a 30 mbsec a for temperature with an ambient temperature of 77f the temperature of the flash drive average 125f and swing for realom a low a 120f to a high a 130f i could only touch it for 2 or 3 second before it feel alarmingly hot per wikipedia a burn at 111f can take six hour but at 124f can take only 6 second it be well handle like an oldfashioned burn hot light bulb so temperature be stoday i learnedl an issue and there be significant speed throttle a well,Average
i falsely assume this be a flash drive it be not it have both a cdrom partition and an inaccessable flash partition that can only be open by run their supply exe file i be hope i could use this a a normal flash drive for the excellent speed and just rely on window bitlocker for encryption but you can not,Bad
i have a ton of anker product this be the first bad review this thing pas through about 65vac at 50ua through the usb shield while not enough to hurt you you can definitely feel it should not the shield be connect to ground protect light be light green this be an anker lightning cable,Bad

before buy this tv to use for over the air ota tv viewing go to or dtvgovmap to see what channel you get in your zip code area ota tv be arearegion specific and signal for various tv station vary for realom area to area if your area have poor reception on the channel you be look for just get cable this have nothing to do with the tv i purchase it for ota tv you can use it in other way such a view video through the av cable or via usb it also have a sd card slot i do not see why it would not work with the late stream stick such a roku chromecast 1st generation amazon fire stick and so on a a tv it be excellent provide high definition content and will deliver the signal that be send to it by the antenna hence the need to research on your available channel in your area the high power antenna that they provide in the package be useless if you want to use it to get ota channel you have to buy another antenna i purchase the 1byone antenna which have good review and be poweredamplifie use any antenna without an amplifier will get you few channel if any setup be relatively easy it come with a set of manual in different language a stand with a bottom for stability 2 set of rabbit ear antenna they do not work get a separate amplify antenna av cable and a remote control the remote control work well a it should in close proximity the tv have a jack for earphone the earphone function work well but remember that the sound you will get for ota tv will depend on how good your signal be so if the channel have noise or distortion then you shall hear it in your earphone and in the external speaker of course the external speaker be decent alright for this size of tv not dolby surround spectacular if you want good quality sound just get external speaker and use the earphonesheadphone 35 mm jack when the reception be good the picture quality be very good high definition like for the price and size you can not complain about the picture quality however when the signal be poorintermittent the picture get stuck on screen have pixelation disappear and you get a blank screen and so on and forth it can be very for realustrating once connect to the amplify antenna it search for the station quickly and quite well however this be obviously link to the antenna and not the tv itself it have a acdc volt outlet charger so you can charge it to a socket it also come with a car cigarette light charger so you can plug it into your round car power socket it have decent battery time when fully charge about 2 hour i would say it take about 1 hour to fully charge the picture show look a bit blurred but that be the phone camera not the actual picture the actual picture be amazing,Good

the plugable usbhub10c2 be a premium usb 30 hub for realom a u base manufacturer of mainly usb base device and accessory the company be head by a techie and customer service be handle by real people that speak your language and live on the same continent plugable in contrast to many other supplier of product like this seem to have excellent after sale support in the form of firmware update there be one available for this hub on their support site and i recommend you check to see if it apply to yours if you choose to buy this almost nobody else will provide firmware update package for a usb hub i ve have an ongoing conversation via email with one of their support representative and have really enjoy be able to speak to someone naturally about the product who clearly have a good knowledge about what they be support and be not just use support script and template to give you boilerplate response that may or may not even address what you re speak about my thought about the hub itself follow the hub ship with a quality worldwide voltage 12v 4a ac adapter with worldwide regulatory and quality certification standard ul fcc icc ce ccc intact this be important a i have come across some low cost chinese market charger that lack any type of print standard compliance and their reliability and safety just can not be guarantee without these it have an efficiency rating of v which be currently a strict standard than be require for new product be sell in north america be iv 10 port be a large number of port for a single usb hub all support the full power requirement per the standard usb specification under any real world usage scenario i like the flexibility of the two flip up port sometimes you just want to stick something in vertically so you can remove it easily and sometimes you want it hide away like a cable and you can do both this way the other thing about the flip up port be that they happen to be the two port that support the bce 12 charge standard so the flipping also easily identify they if you have any bce 12 compliant device while all port will charge these two can provide high current if the device can support it many usb ac charger will charge device at even high current but none of they be usb hub and can not be directly compare i charge my phone nexus 5 up quite quickly while write part of this review and i even forget to use one of the port designate for charge i test the hub on two vastly different machine just to get a good idea about whether it would run into any issue in the old or new world the first host machine i try be an old dell laptop core 2 duo my office provide to i eon ago which be stoday i learnedl run window 7 professional and have only usb 20 port the hub be recognize and driver be instal instantly and it be immediately ready to go of course i have zero usb 30 capability in this situation since the host port be usb 20 but all of the port operate a expect with no problem with performance or hiccup during long datum transfer the second machine i test it with be a new modern desktop i build myself which support usb 30 and be run window 10 professional a before everything work automagically once power and plug into a usb 30 port that i for realee up on the motherboard i test a number of usb 30 device simultaneously include a combination 3 port usb 30 hub and gigabit ethernet adapter i just happen to have on my desk a well a a couple usb 30 portable hdd and find everything perform just a if they be plug directly into my pc i also perform the firmware update available on the product support page here which take only a matter of second and follow by a power cycle and everything be up and run again i would have like to see the change note for the firmware update but i could not find they something tell i if i be to ask plugable they would have they in my inbox in no time though finally i move it quickly over to one of my server which run the late 1510 release of ubuntu server just to verify that it get recognize and operate but i do not go through all of the device test again at this point i be already convince that there be nothing bad to report about the actual functionality be provide by the hub important to note that the hub do not work at all unless the external power adapter be use and plug in some small hub with le port will operate in datum sync mode without their power adapter but this one just have too much go on inside of it to be bus power not really a good or bad thing just a thing since the hub itself be rather large and would not be my first choice to pack in my bag on a business trip anyway even if i do not have to worry about the large power adapter the piano black finish be attractive but a fingerprint dust and scratch magnet and i would have prefer a finely texture matte finish case stoday i learnedl if you re crazy about fingerprint these finish do wipe down easily so it not a big deal there be a single blue led on top of the unit that be constantly light when the hub be power it would have be great if individual led be add above each of the port to visually display which port be connect to an active device in case you have a lot of device plug in via long wire that have thing plug in and out but give that each of the port other than the two flip up port behave identically it far for realom a necessity there be a good weight to the hub and four small antiskid foot on the bottom but i stoday i learnedl find that it slide slightly around on a clean glass surface when push and pull cable and device out of the port which mean it be stoday i learnedl a two handed affair the whole thing feel like it be build well the case do not squeak and creak when handle it and the weight suggest it not make of razor thin cheap plastic that ll end up crack if you accidentally forget it in your car in the middle of january plugable be pretty transparent about the internal design on their web site share internal diagram of how the usb controller be map to the port and which chipset be be use even let we know if some point in time manufacturing change to a different chipset for the same model the bottom line that i ve come away with here be that while you may be able to find a powered usb 30 hub for slightly le money elsewhere you almost definitely be not go to get something back by the same quality of support and you may or may not get something with the same quality of component be provide here since be definitely not talk order of magnitude in difference of price if you re in need of a large capacity desktop hub i have absolutely no problem fully recommend this one note that i receive a product sample for the purpose of an honest and unbiased review i always take the cost of the product into consideration when write my review in these case i be not require to write nor do i ever promise a positive review,Good
fantastic head unit i have this instal in my 2005 accord look great fit sturdy and have all the feature in the description work a expect i be have some trouble get bluetooth call to work but once i update the unit with a micro sd card everything work fine people have mention the sun glare be bad it be but for realom my experience all head unit suffer for realom this equally,Good
work great with my brand new acer aspire switch alpha 12 usb c port i ve test the vga hdmi and the gigabit ethernet port and they all work a expect the only negative thing for a tablet type laptop be that the cord could be long so it be able to sit on the table when in use i know everyone make stuff for apple and that the usb c port be on the table already but that s not the case in my case when plug in the vga and hdmi cable you have to that first then plug it into the usb c port the gigabit ethernet and usb port will work hot but not the display adapter plus only one can be use at a time but that s expect,Good
i ve be use this drive at work and home and be very happy with it performance and design i have the 1 tb model which when format in window use ntfs end up be 932gbs the outer casing consist of hard plastic and the green silicone material you can see in the photo the green silicone be actually what be surround the hard drive inside protect it for realom drop and be how the suspension system work the green silicone also have a slot that go all the way around which be use to hold onto the include usb 30 cable use 2 clip the 2 plastic piece simply screw into each other on each side use 4 screw the usb port have a flap in the silicone to keep it close and for realee of dust when not in use there be also 2 opening on the bottom plastic part where 2 green strip come through and provide grip on whatever surface you put it on prevent slip simple and effective design for protection grip and convenience there be no external powered need for this power it take for realom the usb port on whatever device you be use it with copying to and for realom the drive be speedy and i the speed i receive when run a speed test be about what i expect for a traditional hard drive over usb 30 i attach a photo of my result which be 1200 mb read and 1158 mb write for sequenthanks in advancel write i m not sure if silicon power want i to do this but i do it anyways i unscrew the 4 screw to see what drive be inside i know silicon power do not manufacture hard drive like western digital and seagate do i be hope to find a brand name for realom one of the very few large drive manufacturer and i be happy to report i do inside be a 1 tb standard seagate laptop drive not some cheap white label drive a quality brand drive good choice i have not test the ability to survive a drop because i be actually use this on a daily basis so i be be slightly cautious i be however throw it into a backpack fill with thing and plop it down on a desk multiple time a day you do not want to treat any standard hard drive with move part too terribly but so far so good no problem with performance or any strange issue overall this have be a great drive for i and i recommend it to anyone look for a more durable external drive to take on the go if anything change i will update this review in the future i receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review i hope this review be helpful,Good

model print on manual not on the box y3025 rise gold usb30 to dual sata 6 g docking station with offline cloning function no it do not sanitize a far a i knowbut i can run dban for realom my pc for that fantastic device highly recommend this anyone who can swap out their own hard drive this successfully clone a raid 0 system 2 hard drive onto 2 brand new hard drive i do have some learn curve but on my 2nd attempt be successful a few thing to note that be not in the manual offline cloning 3 second long press 100 light illuminate report it ready to clone 1 fast follow up press to begin and the 25 light should begin flash if you press the button a 3rd time the 25 light will behave a if it cloning but the device will not continue to clone i spend 3 hour on this simply power down the device and re start 25 50 75 100 light will flash while one at a time if it at 75 do the 25 and 50 light will be solid blue and both ab light will also be solid amber when it at it for this example 75 age of completion only that one light will flash i find this a bit extra nice consider i presume all the light would flash but it a elegant a it can be raid cloning if you re clone a raid setup you must 1st run all the new hard drive in your computer and format they to your raid of preference in my case raid 0 yes i know stripe be stupid and i would prefer 5 now but it be my 1st ever raid build 8 year agoid actually prefer 10 with parity but i only have 2 drive so here it be it take i more time to plug in the new hard drive than it do to format they to raid 0 complete a soon a i hit the enter keyjust flag your hard drive check your motherboard manual after your new hard drive be set to raid then clone they a normal otherwise you may get the no operating system message temperature take for realom a digital thermometer 73f for the base it stay at room temperate the entire time 98f on the source hdd seagate always run hot 85f on the target hdd new wd blue 1 tb my old drive reach upper 90 98x f and my new drive stay around 80 this be also help with a small 5 desk fan blow down a channel for a focused current of for realesh air i feel that my old seagate drive which be extremely noisy be about to retire and they run hot heat be not good so if you be do this operation i would advise to ensure you have proper air flow time every clone take roughly the same time i run this 4 time for the raid 0 twice for each drive due to my neglecting to first set each new drive a a raid prior to cloning and time each clone process i take screenshot of a timer on my phone on each 25 increase across 2 separate 750 gb 7200rpm hdd onto 2 separate 1 tb 7200rpm hdd total for each for realom 0100 be 3 hour 10 minute to 325 the 2nd hdd take 3 hour 15 minute 025 42 minute 2550 123 hrminute 41 minute 5075 210 hrsminute 47 minute 75100 312 hrsminute 1 hour 2 minute these be 750 gb hdd and guess if you have 5 tb drive it would be at least 5 time a long keep that in mind do this twice take i for realom 10 pm untoday i learned sound inaudible unless you be to put your ear to it my original seagate 750 gb hdd be make a huge clicking racket and crunch it be irritate to hear they grind but that be in use on the pc during the cloning there be barely any audible sound i want to put a stethoscope to they but just listen closely be enough to hear the drive spin up and make subtle click read and the new drive write it be very subtle but there be also a noticable click at least on my exp sofar when it end if you re in a libraby you would barely notice it and i have to struggle to listen for any que but there be a few you can hear tiny movement during the cloning but otherwise it a very silent operation when i first turn the device on and the drive be inside i can hear they spin up but they slow down and i do not think they spin fast at all because it be impossible to hear they across a room and the old one be noise seagate that do not make a single crunch or grind during the successful cloning cloning hdd for datum work so perfectly on a backup hdd that a window pc can not have both hdd active at the same time it copy over 160 gb of backup photo raw and post work do too perfectly down to the byte both drive one very very old and another new can both be use now space newly clone hdd which may have more capacity will be clone to the exact size for realom the source however after you start up your pc in both raid0 or a a backup hdd you can yes you can claim all unused space on the new target hdd for my raid 0 i simply make a new volume now i have volume 0 original hdd and a volume 1 with all the gb i pay for note at first the new hdd will have unallocated space and the o if you re run winx will need to have it set a mountable 1st not go into how to do that here but it be easy for i to reclaim all the for realee space on both the raid hdd and the backup spare dd which have gb of unused unallocated space after the clone ext3 ext4 lvm not test on my linux mahcine yet will update when the hdd arrive so there s my hopefully helpful review cover what i have not see elsewhere speed seem fine the operation be a simple a cook a potato the look of it be superb and whoever decide to create a rose gold version i salute you i m glad i buy this and like the low output led that do not blind and the metal for realame work with the dust cover too even the cord be high quality silicon cover like mac use i ve never own a mac but do admire the detail that this unit have someone take their time and bring this to market fully test and then make a elegant a i ve ever see thank you for all of it a it appreciate at least by i i have more pix,Good

in all this appear to be a good surge protector outlet which have one thing that make it a notch well than most the switchable outlet by add a switch to each outlet this protector can be use to cut power to each individual plug which could reduce slave energy when you have a powered down product that say since each of the switch be an up down switch with no indicator light it be a little hard to determine if the individual outlet be on or off it also come with usb charge port which in this day and age be simply a necessity this surge protector be perfect under the desk since i can use the usb outlet to power the lead light on the desk and charge my phone while use the other outlet for laptop etc in all a super handy surge protector which i receive for a straightforward review,Good

i receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review i be not influence by anyone in any way of my opinion of this product i take pride in review product a my husband and i both also rely on review of other i have never see one of these before now this be quite the nifty little portable keyboard it take i some time to get use to i stoday i learnedl keep hit the wrong key but i m slow get the hang of it i do not think it a keyboard i would use on a day to day basis but it great for when we go camping to the park stay at a hotel travel time it pretty much travel ready be that it quite thin flexible foldable i be able to fit it right in my purse i do wish it come with a nice little carrying case or velvet carry bag but i will make due the key be nonnoise the only thing you hear be your finger hit the silicone key the keyboard have 107 key the she will be make of durable waterproof silicone yes i put it in water for about 20 min everything appear to be work stoday i learnedl it super easy to clean and nothing get catch under the key like food piece which be really good because i sometimes eat while i m on my tabletcomputer or laptop the instruction say it be compatible with a mac but when my husband try it on his mac it would not work what do not work the number lock cap lock scroll lock some of the other key so i guess it not for a mac but work great on my desktop pc window overall in my personal opinion it a nice keyboard affordable and great for someone travelingvacatione,Good
buyer beware when use with some usbc to usbc cable you might get speed cap 40mbs apr 26 2016 update i change my review score to 5 to reflect the additional test i ve do to clarify the speed cap myth with macbook after i consult with apple forum i get a answer that i might need a usb 30 usbc to usbc cable so i do a search and the only cable mention usb 31 10gbs support be for realom belkin belkin 3foot 31 usb type c usbc to usb type c cable usbc certify and i test with macbook it correctly recognize with usb 30 speed and push speed to it limit photo 78 so in conclusion if you want to achieve good performance with usbc cable make sure you have a usbc cable support at least 5gbs transfer speed and some cable like apple usbc google usbc anker usbc they only support 480mbs which be usb 20 standard for datum transfer old review i purchase it to use with my macbook retina 12 because of the usbc support but there be a real problem for this drive to use with usbc to usbc cable if you use it with apple usbc to usbc cable you only get usb 20 speed which be cap at 40mbs in and out like the photo 13 show below if you use it with the accompany usba to usbc cable you will have usb 30 speed which be 400mbs in 425mbs out but the inconvenience part be for macbook you have to use a usbc to usba adapter like the photo 46 show so in conclusion if you purchase it for the usbc convenience and universal support you will disappoint with the speed seriously cap into usb 20 standard for the good performance you have to use the usba to usbc cable which will put it back to the same category of use a microusb cable you ll need adapter to make it work in full speed,Good

this product be a complete disappointment it arrive doa and could not read any of my six old ide hard drive i get this so i can avoid have to hook up my old ide drive to my motherboard through an ide pci express adapter card in the end i end up opening up my computer case to hook up the ide drive to my motherboard for datum retrieval off the old drive edit 20160621 i m update my review for realom a 1star to 4star after having receive a replacement unit that work this time at first however i think the replacement be doa a well because i inithanks in advancelly could not get my window 10 desktop pc to recognize my connect 80 gb western digital ide hard drive what finally make my pc recognize the connected ide hard drive be i jam shove in the power connector to my hard drive really forcefully only then do i hear the hard drive come to life and begin spin this be why i only give this adapter 4star due to the high effort need to connect a simple power cable i ve be build custom pc since 2002 and this be the first time connect a power supply to a hard drive require so much brute force and push in with that say once i hear the hard drive spin up i connect the usb cable to my pc and after about 12 minute window 10 automatically detect and add the hard drive a usb storage and i could see the ide hard drive under device and drive i m just worried about how durable this adapter will be longtime due to it power connector issue require so much brute force and effort also a you can see in my picture it look quite messy once everything be connect together a more elegant solution would be to connect the ide hard drive inside some enclosure like those usb enclosure case for 25 drive so thing would look neater in the end a long a the adapter prove to be durable it be stoday i learnedl good value,Good
sabrent hbb7c3 usb 30 7 port hub 3 smart charge port with switch be a solid unit make of a nice hard plastic case and a black mirror finish face plate there be a rubber ring around the bottom base that keep the hub for realom move horizontally while plug in or remove a device just be sure to take off the protective film on the bottom to enable it grip the top face plate also have a protective film that should be remove to give it a glossier appearance many people have a usb hub connect to their computer and either a stand alone charger for phone tablet and other device this hub take the place of both of they it slender space save design can really save some desk space sabrent have pack this unit nicely with the hub on top and the power brick ac plug and usb cable underneath for a desktop device the usb cable be very short if a full tower pc be be use there be barely enough cable to place the hub on the desktop if the usb port be near the top of the computer let alone place the hub in a particular place on the desk the hub plug in to a rather large power brick which an ac cord plug into the wall or a surge suppressor this be pretty typical for this type of product there be an adequate amount of power cord for the brick to reach the floor the top 7 port of the hub will connect to the computer technically they will also charge the bottom 3 be only for charge device and do not connect to the pc connect the hub to the pc be easy just plug the cable into an open usb 30 port on the computer plug the ac cord into outlet and it be ready to be use any usb device can be connect the hub be backward compatible so even old device should work without any issue in the past other hub that have be use have trouble with a usb 2 drive and a usb 3 drive be connect at the same time drop the usb 2 drive this hub do not have this issue so far the sabrent hub have work flawlessly keep in mind that this hub be always power on there be a white lead power light at the top if there be a hard drive connect it will continue to spin even when the computer be power off if it do not have the spin down circuitry build into it bluetooth device may continue to stay connected when the computer be shut down usually most computer will turn off all of these device at shut down this be where the power switch come in to play each port have it own switch with a corresponding blue led that light up when the power be on luckily sabrent opt not to use annoyingly bright led like some other company do the led be mount below the faceplate so they be more subtle the switch allow the user to decide what device stay on or off for those who just like to walk away for realom the computer after shut down this may be a nuisance because they manually need to switch device off other may like have the control sabrent have a nice hub here the only thing that would make it well be if they provide a long usb cord luckily it be not hard wire so at an extra cost one can be purchase but it should should not have to be,Good

i be mainly disappoint because this unit be suppose to be key chain mountable and the extra micro usb port be suppose to be a plus well the micro usb port odesnt work on any of my phone or tablet apparently you need real jailbroken android with power on usb not sure the exact lingo but need to power the device via usb port for this to be see by the phone or tablet in my case none have it or be disable by their respective manufacturer so strike one here strike two no way you can stick this on a keychain without damage it it will not go into standard size keychain ring have to go with a small and more maleable bendable piece and stoday i learnedl that barely loop and do damage to the plastic removable cap the way it be design samsung do not take into account the angle that the round keychain ring would try to approach the unit and punch a hole to small to take into measurement the circumference of the oval ring in other word if you try a round ring it be almost impossible to install without scuff the plastic the plastic end up take damage due to the bad design so now it do not look so cool if they make keychain ring square i guess that would ve work another downsize be that when you have to take it out of the keychain you will have to remove both the cap and the stick on leave cap on the keychain either way separate they and move one around to release for realom the keychain be a chore the memory size be a big plus and thank to that at least i will not have to carry drive with i 128 gig be enough for most job so i guess that s the main reason why i be keep it interesting idea for mount but bad implementation by samsung,Average
i have be use cable or the harddisk sata to usb adapter for a while and find out the cable be degrading so a the speed so it time to find a replacement and buy this one a a replacement i be satisfied with the quality of the product feature and the speed of data transfer there be several note and highlight here this be not an enclosure nor raid design so if you be look for those function you probably need to find something else with that say it be more for temporary or shortterm use especially you need to duplicate or hook up bare harddrive for clone datum transfer backup forensic and the like it make thing and operation much easy both bay can be use i have try put in one 35 and one 25 drive without problem window and linux machine can recognize they right away build be solid and have a solid grip on the desk that it will not move around the offline clone be awesome feature especially you need to do some forensic task make a clone in very short time without connect to pc and just clone the drive with a single button on the dock can not be easy than that it come with 25 increment progress led to show the cloning process progress usb 30 datum speed even if you just hook it up for backup your old computer harddrive it easy and fast of course your new computer require a usb 30 port in order to achieve that lightning speed recommend if you have multiple harddrive for realom time to time to do data transfer or clone it will be a very helpful and convenient tool,Good

i m go to give this product 5 star because i be satisfied with their performance to price ratio i recently get a gaming laptop for schoolgaming and heat be a big concern for i especially with low end model gaming laptop i have an msi gl62 laptop with dual rear exaust and an already excellent cool system but i figure lower be well i have try a cool pad and the difference be virtually non existent although i only get a cheap model for realom good buy the fan be very pathetic and they do not move enough air to make a difference i m go to be return the cool pad i end up buy 2 of these and be concern by it low max fan rpm 2800 i believe and not be able to help my temperature i be happy to say they do work maybe the average temp decrease be roughly 5c on average and not only that but during loading screen etc it help to cool down my cpu and gpu significantly fast than with just stock fan with this laptop and dual exaust fan i rarely reach over 60c gpucpu even with a slightly overclocked gpu i run they at max speed whenever my pc be on with the dial on the side it nice that you can turn they off all the way if you turn the dial all the way off there s a little click at max speed their reallh be not much sound i have a box fan on low to move air in my room and they can not be hear over it even with it off you have to be sit super close to notice the sound for realom this fan a lot of the low model of these do not have many review and i be concerned that they would not perform well i seriously consider buy the opolar brand but 25 to 30 dollar each seem steep and i do not need any fancy lcd temp on the fan i use internal temperature readout such a speedfan msi afterburner and the preinstalle app dragon gaming center have temp a well overall if you need a fan that work at an affordable price i would highly reccomend these fan they re quiet even at max speed and do help to keep your laptop cooler,Good
fake review illegitimate seller either way two huge thumb down the constantly on blue light would be a big downside if it be in my bedroom not my study however that fall to the wayside in comparison with the terrible performance of this pad it be a joke how weak these fan be seriously they do next to nothing i try to think of a way to show visually just how pathetic these fan be and upload a customer photo of they fail to lift even a single sheet of singly ply toilet paper this could never hope to cool my laptop down i rarely write review let alone go through the effort to include a photo but hopefully i save at least one person for realom make this mistake please heed my warning i have never hear of avantek before but i have make a vow to crusade against they after they feed i over with this product which obviously should never have make it to market unless my model be defective somehow if the strength of the fan be no concern for you why be you shop for a cool pad then consider how slick the surface be my laptop which have rubber gripper on the bottom stoday i learnedl slide off if i put the foot up or how unreasonable the placement of the usb port and power switch be on the back i have try multiple usb cable outlet etc for realom different source and nothing make the fan strong edit be about 2 year and the fan be stoday i learnedl work just a slow a day 1 led have not die stoday i learnedl dislike this product oh yeah it do have that cool x in the middle though,Bad

i buy this unit and instal it in place of the factory radio on 1995 tacoma 4x4 ex cab this be an old car make almost 20 year ago so i expect to have some issue fit the modern radio it in i be surprised the issue be not that big and the radio fit with little change 1 the standard 2bay sleeve do not fit in my truck the original radio be mount with factory make bracket that do not follow current mount standard also only two hole in toyotafactory bracket match thread hole in planet audio radio case to assure solid grip i enlarge other two hole in the factory bracket so they mate with thread hole in the radio case that do the trick and planet audio p9640b fit perfectly in the opening there be no need for supply for realame a the original dash panel fit over the for realont panel of the radio it look like the radio be build for this truck 2 the radio bay in my tacoma be not very deep there be air vent duct behind the radio p9640b fit in the opening a long a you do not use standard rca plug on the back the original radio antenna be ok but i want to use a backup camera which should be connect to rca input on the back if standard rca plug be connect the radio be stick out about 12 inch i make a custom lshape rca plug for backup camera and that solve the problem it be tight fit without much space leave but it work other connector and wire include additional wire harness to plug into tacoma plug fit behind and below the radio without problem back usb connector be put in the glow box now about the functionality of the radio the user manual do not tell you all thing this radio can do so this be what i find so far 1 radio bootsup in reasonable time around 5 second it only can be annoyingly long when you start the car and want to use backup camera you have to wait and stare at planet audio logo for 5 second before you can see what be behind your car there be additional 2 second delay for source the signal so actually it be 7 second for realom turn the key in the ignition and hear the first sound for realom the radio i d love to have no delay but understanding that it be not a just the radio but a computer i must accept it it stoday i learnedl fast than boot up any of the my computer smart tv cell phone tablet or pc 2 screen visibility be much well than in my samsung gallaxy s4 the glare be almost not there in my truck the radio be quite low and mostly hide for realom direct sun so i can not tell how direct sun affect the display visibility the touch be responsive even through original protective film i have no need to take it out yet hardwired button be easy to press and the volume knob feel right for night drive the screen can be turn off and blue light around button be not distract 3 radio play cd vcd dvd dvd be not region for realee but it be match the region select in the radio region menu so if you want to watch dvd for realom u you need to select your radio region to u in this setting you will not be able to play dvd make for other region for example to play dvd for realom europe you need first set the radio for realequency to europe standard this be not describe in the manual but it work 4 bluetooth easy pair with my samsung galaxy s4 in phone and audio mode all sound for realom the phone be play on the radio use phone control so you can listen to the music i listen audio book for realom the phone music player or stream pandora tunein etc phone control work for realom touch screen on the radio with addition of hardwired hungup and answerdial button on the right site the preamp volume can be set in radio set bt volume so you can preset the volume of the phone without turn the volume knob the bt sound quality be great the drive noise do not affect the sound quality when talk on the phone before i could not use speaker phone on samsung galaxy s4 while drive i place the external mike on the steering column and it pick up my voice with no background noise 5 before play for realom usb and micro sd card the radio will will scan the content of the card or stick quite fast 16 g sd full of audio book over 2 thousand song be scan in reasonably time the mp3 tag be show while play together with long file name however you can play song in order they be in folder not for realom mp3 tag the bad thing be that you can not see the long folder name or file name only short name 8dot3 format so if your folder with the whole album have name the rolling stone now it will show up on the navigation panel a therol1 the same format be use to display file name in the folder 8dot3 format play for realom usb and sd card have autostart mean the radio will start play the first song a soon a it finish scan the radio scan usb or sd every time it be select to play for realom it or resume after turn the radio on however the radio remember where it be play before be turn off and if the usb or sd content do not change the radio resume for realom the last play note it take i a while to figure out that you can not navigate between folder while song be play in order to change folder you have to stop not pause but stop play and then you can navigate to different folder use touch screen however after you start play again the little icon break arrow remain on the left top of the screen this icon represent the one level up navigation allow you to navigate around the folder while the previously select song be play i just find it few day ago 6 radio be quite sensitive and sound quality be well than factory tacoma radio i confirm that the radio have rds the radio clock be synchronize automatically with the time receive for realom rds signal i find some radio station be not good at keep their clock in sync with world clock so when change the radio station i find the clock on the radio be change by few minute a well this be one of the what the heck moment 7 the amplifier in the radio be standard what you can expect for realom the radio actually it be a bit louder than my factory radio i never have a need to run it in full blast and even drive the truck at 75 mph where speed limit allow the road noise allow i to listen to the book at volume around 30 out of 40 max the bottom line be i be very happy with this purchase for le than 200 i upgrade my truck radio to all functionality i could think of before i start shop for a radio i list all function i want backup camera input with 6 inch screen sd usb aux dvd with vcd and region for realee rds radio bt for phone and audio rotary volume control and illumination not distract while drive at night i want the radio that be hard mount so it will look like it be factory instal all these feature i find in planet audio p9640b edit 20140915 just few day ago i find that you can navigate around folder on usb stick i do not try that trick on cdrom while the song be play it look like you can not navigate after the inithanks in advancel autoplay start but after you stop autoplay and the select song to play the one level up navigation icon stay on the screen allow you to navigate around folder good thing that after turn the radio on the radio resume play for realom usb or sd i have also time the speed of read the content of 2 gb usb drive very old the drive contain 17 folder album total about 180 song it take 3 second between switch the source to usb and start play the music within this time radio take about 07 second to switch to usb screen than be about 05 second pause and the rest be show the progress of read number of song and percent of completion edit 20150222 after several month of use this radio i m stoday i learnedl very fond of it if someone for realo planet audio read these review there be two suggestion for realom for realom i regard product firmware these be the only thing that annoy i 1 backup camera volume there be a setting where you set the radio volume when the backup camera be active i think the idea be to be able to set low volume or even turn the sound off when you be focus on the driving in reverse what annoy i be that this setting be absolute volume level regardless of what you be listen too i find that the radio signal be very loud and when i turn on the radio i set the volume to about 8 and that be loud enough on the other hand the mp3 music i have record on my phone bt input or micro sd card be on the mild site so i use the volume about 30 for that for the backup camera volume i set the volume to 12 so when i listen to audiobook mp3 for realom the phoneand i m back up i do not miss the reading but when i m listen to the radio and put my truck in reverse everybody include i jump out of their seat with the what the heck moment that how loud the radio be at volume 12 i wish the backup camera volume can be set to the percent of normal volume instead of absolute value then it would make more sense 2 micro sd card be read and play the order how file and folder be put on the card or maybe it be alphabetic order of 8dot3 file name in any way it be annoying when you use window for copy file and folder to micro d card window copy file in random order and if i want to copy the entire audio book which be something like 600 file all file be play like randomly not in long file name sequence the good would be if mp3 file be read and organize in by the radio use mp3 tag but i know it would take much long than read all directory and file name and sort they for play so at least it would be nice if radio sequence file for play use long file name these two thing be not really show stopper and can be live with but it would be much nice radio if the firmware could be update by that keep in mind that these be all undocumented feature and other manufacturer might have similar problem include big brand name even they do not advertize they most of current electronic product be control by microprocessor and be very complicated with specific functionality depend on the programmer who write the firmware for they and because some specific detail be not in functional design they be program by the good understanding of the programmer and of course they be never document edit 20150807 i have add some photo of my radio instal in 95 tacoma it over a year since i ve instal the radio it stoday i learnedl work and look like new i have not even pile of the screen protection yet now look at the stock photo of the screen i guess planet audio update the firmware a my screen look different see the photo unless i m miss something and they drop the price a bit nice i wonder if the firmware can be update without send the radio to the factory maybe there be an option to update the firmware via sd i would really like to have the annoying thing with 8dot3 file name for realom sdusb update to long file name and fix the volume change when switch to reverse edit 20150901 there be some question regard play m3u file and camera installation so i short 1 m3u be not recognize on usb or sd card 2 backup camera be esky ec17006 world smallest hd color ccd waterproof vehicle car rear view backup camera 170 degree view angle rearview camera086065050 inch instal in trailer hitch plug it be removable in case i would need to tow something 3 the camera do not have night vision but like you can see on the picture the image be quite ok even in the bad condition street light be blind the camera by the way the image on the monitor be a little bit well than show on the picture a the camera use to take this picture add it noise it be dark 4 i have attach picture of what the monitor be show when the truck be park next to the wall in the parking garage and the picture show the distance between the bumper and camera and the wall 5 yesterday i notice one feature this radio do not have when play cd i go the late pink floyd cd endless river when play it on planet audio in my tacoma the screen show just the track number and track duration see the picture however when i put the same cd into my 2012 4runner factory radio basic model radio i could see the album name and song title it must be somewhere on this cd that 4runner factory radio can read it and planet audio not i just think i might share it edit 20170810 it be almost 3 year and the radio be stoday i learnedl like new actually i have never remove the original screen protector a touch screen be easy visible and responsive with that plastic on it after 3 year of use it the only annoying thing be that 7 second delay for realom start the engine to be able to see the backup camera image i ve drive car with backup camera in factory unit and they solve the long boot issue by what look like hardwire backup camera to screen bypass the internal computer i mean the radio might stoday i learnedl not finish boot up but the image on the backup camera show up in le than a second for realom

at first i be a little skeptical about order this cable see a how many negative and positive review it be receive but to my surprise it exceed my expectation overview the cable be exactly a depict in the picture it very simple it a female xlr to male usb this mean you connect a device to the cable to send audio to your computer it very easy convenient and have great quality just plug in to your computer and it automatically install the driver for you so you can get record the usb plug have a small bulb that light up when it connect to a powered source very satisfied technical specification the device register a a usb pnp sound device this devicecodec be common for most usb device and your computer should install the driver with no problem mine do the cable have a maximum recording rate of 2 channel 16bit 48000 hz dvd quality which be not bad for local recording but not very suitable for album recording or studio production it include a microphone boost feature that add more power to the source you re record but compensate with a hiss in the background it can also be use a a playback device if you re connect a computer to a mixer or a related device the process for do this however be not very simple but the cable allow you to do so the maximum playback quality be 24 bit 96000 hzwhich be very good for home speaker and for a usb device the use for this cable can be a practical a plug in and recording use a microphone guitaror any other instrument or device that have a male xlr output the cable have a very robust and thick coating on it ensure it durability overall i m very satisfied with this purchase it have last i a while and i ve do several high quality sound guitar recording so far,Good

review this radio might take awhile i restore show car and so i be quite detailed with the installation in the ugly avalanche i hate every truck ever make but i stoday i learnedl need it to travel at the moment i purchase the radio because i want to have build in navigation and backup camera i already have the sirius satellite service and i remove a perfectly good radio to install the new one i also want to thank the people who add their comment and recommendation on amazon it really help when you look at the radio it leave you with the impression that this will be an easy install wrong nothing be easy if you want to make it look cool i also want the radio to preserve the onstar and steering wheel volume control it do that and do not laugh i do the install over three weekend i end up order the radio the esky ec17006 hd color ccd waterproof car rear view backup camera good product the crux soogm15 radio replacement interface really need the sirius transceiver necessary and the american international gmk422 dash install kit helpful the price of this project be about 400 when i first receive the part i start look at wiring diagram and determine that i would have to build a wiring harness to make the installation go more smoothly if you be instal this radio make sure there be room for all the component and they do take space i solder and shrink wrap all the connection i be not in a hurry and i use to do this type of work i have to figure out how well the radio fit it not perfect but good enough my neighbor think it be great and now he want one and i to help he sound like a good time to take a vacation the other for realustrating part be the antenna placement all of a sudden you have a gps and sirius antenna to deal with the avalanche already have a transceiver but i could not use it figure out how to place the antenna take a lot of time and some test drive the sirius satellite be south do not place the sirius antenna inside it have a magnetic base also i end up mount it on the passenger side roof right at the corner where the glass and door meet this keep the expose wire really short about an inch the magnetic base be strong but i also add some clear silicone i keep think about car wash rip it off i place the navigation antenna inside the car on the passenger side a pillar and it will be cover with plastic molding for realom what i can tell the navigation work fine since my cell phone work in the car i figure the antenna would not be a much of an issue at the apillar there be another cable with an external microphone so you can connect your cell phone to the system i have not try this yet and i have not determine where to put the microphone there be also more wiring with the camera video lead and i also want to connect it to a backup signal lead i end up create a cable with the video cable and backup signal wire you will have a lot of wire to deal with if you want to get the maximum use for realom the radio take your time and go slow the ugly avalanche have a tow package and i wire the camera into the reverse light wire and the camera be power when you select reverse and the same signal wire go back to the radio the crux body kit be quite complete and it support bose and non bose system it also work with the truck radio amplifier the instruction be not too bad but you have to research what you actually have in my case it refer to instal option which i have to look up i end up test each feature separately untoday i learned they work most of the time consume stuff be mount the radio and route the wire select a location and route the antenna lead for the sirius transceiver and route the cable to the rear of the avalanche which take some time the radio work fine i have not fully test the navigation part and they allow you to download the update map for realee of charge one time i have not do this yet the radio come with a remote and the manual be quite long at night it be a bit bright and i need to tone it down the backup camera be great during the day and night the radio look good in the dash and the steering wheel volume control work great the channel selection button only work go back and not forward if you press the button to go forward it also go back the documentation also warn of this it will take time to learn the remote one complaint on the radio be that it take time to boot up and turn on over 20 second however the reverse camera part will work before the radio be boot up that part be ok i use to have a bmw 545i that have a radio that take awhile to boot up also software be in everything the next test will be the navigation and then i may try to pair my phone with bluetooth i apologize for the long detail i type really fast maybe these detail will help someone i do like the radio and will be satisfied with it if i run into anything else worth document i will update this thread,Good
this be the second one i have purchase to install in polaris rzr utv these stereo be a little different than the typical one on the market they be durable with a metal outer bezel and have very durable button they take a little while to get use to use since the navigation be a little meticulous but it stoday i learnedl simple to figure out after mess with it a few minute also note most stereo will have two hot wire one constant power directly to the battery and one acc that turn on and off with the key this stereo only have the one hot wire for realom the acc so it will not drain your battery the bluetooth function work very easy the usb side of thing leave feature to be desire after instal a large 32 gb flash drive into this with hundred of album i discover you can not navigate easily to locate your music the stereo have clean sound and enough power to not need an amplifier to use this in a rzr i pair this with the pioneer tsx200 3 way speaker and it be a good combo although the speaker be not waterproof the big perk of this stereo be i always power wash the interior of my rzr after ride and i can power wash the stereo without any issue would recommend this for a boat or off road atvutv,Good

a retractable cable that actually retract when you want it to without have to rewind it like an old mix tape i ve be look a similar cable for a while but have not make the jump untoday i learned i fall upon these when i begin play with they i notice they have a nice flat cable design and a tight spring to help they rewind if you correctly pull the cable end away for realom center and not one at a time they extend rather nicely while click along different length point to lock at other spot the overall extension of the cable be close to 3 foot and make they pretty handy for travel since they compact to the size of a quarter the only thing i might like to see be a little more security for realom end separation or for realay on the head of the cable overall they be very solid and i hope they prove to last and stay tight when it be time to rewind they i do receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review my opinion have be make fair upon examination and testing of the product and i would recommend it to family for realiend and other shopper alike,Good
for what it be it a good buy the money i pay for it be well spend you get to remember you get what you pay for i do like this radio and it feature but for it be a bos i know it be not that good of a head unit bos be not the good brand out there but for the price of their product they re worth it this radio lack control for amp color change and light brightness control it be loud but it just be not that loud i do not hear distortion when i turn it up but i know my speaker could go up a lot louder but i m not go to complain too much i recommend it but do not expect too much enjoy,Average

work but have some issue with old vhs tape i keep run into a can not copy due to content protection i m try to turn old vhs tape into digital and burn they to dvd for my parent but any interference in the tape stop the recording process and make it so that you have to edit the tape in section to make one whole video later very time consume but when i do have a tape that be in good condition the copy process be great,Average
grant i be a little skeptical about this little amp be able to meet my expectation but i figure for 55 i d give the 2x75w unit a shot i be look for an amp to power two outdoor speaker dual lu43pw that we want to mount on our deck i like the fact that this be everything i need 2channel aux input basstreble control component input and nothing more i actually instal this unit then connect my logitech bluetooth adapter to it via audio component cable to the back of the unit so that i would not have to keep come to the amp just to change song i pair the bluetooth adapter to my phone turn on the amp select a song to play then i honestly cross my finger in hope of half decent sound what i get be amazing clarity bass and vloume at only 13 of the way up grant most of the credit probably need to go to the speaker but i be highly impressed by the sound output on the amp for such a reasonable price now if you be look to wake up your neighborhood this probably be not the unit for you but if you simply want to listen to music in the comfort of your own deckpatio at a fain real lifey loud volume level or simply want some subtle ambiance to a romantic dinner then this little guy will fit the bill the only negative thus far be the fact that the light on the for realont of the unit be really bright so if you plan on set this amp anywhere near a location with lowlight keep in mind that the room will light up blue some like myself may think this be cool while other may find it annoying so it be worth note the usb port will only work with a memory stick up to 2 gb confirm this and will not play any music for realom an ipod via usb have not attempt an android base phone where music be store on a memory card though there be plenty of option around this with other input however,Good
i just get my patriot 32 gb xt flash drive today and man be i impressed like wow this thing rock i have about 16 gb of datum to write to the drive this afternoon that would be 12 1 gb apple iphone and appletv mkv and mp4 movie movie that i custom make for small hd content on a powermac g5 with mactheripper dvd2onex24x and handbrake 091 andor elgatos turbo h264 video encoder tool i make the movie for my iphone 3 g and appletv speak for itself i hope but these movie be specifically lightsmall in term of content gb whereas a normal dvd movie can be anywhere for realom 4 gb to 8 gb in size and the movie be reduce contentwise to be very small mostly le than 1 gb in size virtually all of they i write to patriot today i have be use the movie in my new 121 led backlit lcdscreen equip notebooknetbook an asus 1201n which have a very nice 1368 x 768 hd display true 720p1080p video real estate in a very small formfactor notebooknetbook i simply light up the computer builtin arcsoft total medium theatre 3 software player and it can upscale the video to hd live ie directly for realom my usb flash drive and bam i be watch an hd movie full screen just a quickly a you can say 1080p that be what i be copy the movie to the patriot xt flash drive for and this be it first assignment for medid it pas with fly color where it would have normally take many many minute probably close to an hour or more to copy all those 12 movie to a normal flash drive it only take about 23 minute with the patriot xt i be pretty stunned that it take so little time so i put the drive to the test with hd tune pro read and write test and if you can see my graphic clearly it pretty obvious that this flash drive be a superior device to other flash drive if you can see the first graphic it the read speed and access time plus burst speed of the drive and it astonishing for a flash drive basically it rock the test to the tune of about 28mbsecond twentyeight megabyte per second i have never have a flash drive do that well on any hd tune pro read test like that so then i have the utoday i learnedity test the read and write speed of the flash drive with a 64 mb test sample and bam it knock out a similar performance ie in the 2nd graphic i submit you should be able to clearly see how it perform 1215mbsec write speed and again just le than 30mbsec read speed with a 64 mb test sample incredible speed i do not care how this thing look ugly pretty semitough whatever you know with those speed i think it marvelous do not you patriot xt be by far the fast usb 20 flash drive i ve ever test or use it just phenomenally fast if word can convey what my feeling about this performance be they can hardly describe my shock at such speed for realom a usb flash drive no le right here in my new asus 1201n incredible i do not really have much else leave to say or write at this time a i think those graphic speak for themselves and for the patriot xt it pretty much game over patriot xt win lifetime warranty right can not argue with thatguaranteed for life seem to be make like a brick shirthouse no le with heavyduty rubber waterproof cover probably pretty much shockproof also it seemsi like the lanyard extra that come with it too the cap might get lose but so what who care be careful with it i guesswhat else can one say with write and read speed like that i give this little monster wavey daveys 5star performance benchmark award patriot xt win the prize the trophy the race and certainly the match if somebody else make anything like this i d like to know what it be but right now in february 2010 the patriot xt flash drive be the world absolute fast usb 20 drive it take a bit of flash to impress i but this thing have do it today ill tell you it have thank you patriot memory thank you for make this drive you re the good wavey davey 2042010 addendum 882012 some thing change while other stay the same do not they when i write this review back in early 2010 i have never use or see demonstrate a largebore 32 gb or large flash drive of any manufacturer outperform the patriot xt exporter drive that i base my review on it be simply the most consistently fast reading and write flash drive that i d ever test or see time go on and of course there be eclipse to my sun several in fact with new technology give way to fast and fast flash drive with the usb 30 drive be the fast of they all when push come to shove i stoday i learnedl use my patriot xt exporter flash drive with religion today keep all my important system tool and backup program for maintenance on pc and mac computer and system installer for the major player in rescue someone bacon if the need arise so my trust in the drive have not wane in the 26 year elapse since the review above tonight i be try to find a nice backwards compatible usb 30 flash drive any manufacturer if performance and design be right and after look for almost 2 hour i stoday i learnedl have not come to find the one that jump out and say buy me that s pretty much what happen when i buy the patriot xt xporter 32 gb flash drive that i m write about yet again tonight it simply do a few move and i be catch and capture for good i have not lose the cap for this thing either i make it a fundamental thing to check for on any job or around my studio when i m work at my home office and up to this day i ve not misplace or lose it yet so that s sort of a nonissue with flash drive and my habit it seem maybe your mileage may vary a lot on this topic but i stoday i learnedl have mine 100 intact with lanyard intact also handy that thing too so it look like some of the major fear express in regard to the xporter 32 gb or other size too be null with people who have good work habit the case have be rough up a bit over the year but save for be drop in a for realiend pool twice in the same afternoon literally i ve not have occasion to complain about anything to do with size construction et al none of that either sometimes it a tight squeeze into a usb slot if there s another occupy usb slot right next door but i have not a yet encounter problem with not be able to use the exporter v other type of flash drive shape etc i love the lifetime warranty for realom patriot memory on the gadget to make a compelling case for ownership go good because they will replace it if it ever materially fail in the field forever sort of like have anydvd update forever if you be an early adopter of that particular rest in peaceper like i wasbut even well other impression and perspective recommendation of the past 26 year speed be a good thing even if it now can be say to be average in term of it speed today the patriot xt xporter 32 gb flash drive have have a good life in my busy hand with project come and go like the wind blow in denver i mean i use this thing a lot and trust it with all my good and most important it system maintenance tool installer and the like for pc and mac and server maintenance plus a couple gb volume of my own photo and composition work itself for show prospective client after almost 3 year of ownership of this device i have no regret whatsoever and i be totally pleased with it performance in missioncritical situation and my own personal use too so thank patriot memory i even buy a couple set of ddr3 1600mhz patriot computer memory for other not myself base on this one record with i since my use of the xporter have be nothing short of fantastic i believe patriot to be a quality company consumeroriente and customerservice seem to be a genuine priority at the company also plus they be local here in california my neighbor so to speak should i have need of their service patriot xt xporter 32 gb flash drive have just plain be a winner for i and i stoday i learnedl recommend patriot flash drive over other brand base on my experience with it plain jane simple that s wavey daveys take on thing of any substance relate to this flash drive and all the negative thing i read about it inithanks in advancelly the concern go to lose the cap i just know it fear and the like experience have prove all those thing to be of no concern for myself i bet a lot of other owner of patriot memory device feel

the xinmeng xm326 gaming mouse offer a lot of style but only moderate sensitivity compare to some other gaming mouse in it class the maximum of 4000dpi do not meet the standard of gamer who demand high sensitivity while some other inexpensive gaming mouse offer 7200dpi while stoday i learnedl keep a 1000hz polling rate the xm326 cap out a bit on the low side it stoday i learnedl a very respectable option and it do a good job while look good at the same time pro attractive design and light good sensitivity sturdy braid usb cable con only moderate sensitivity at 4000dpi max instruction only in chinese single dpi switch the xm326 have a solid design with high quality construction the customizable led lighting also add a good deal of style to the unit the grip on the size be solid with some inset area and thumbfinger rest the mouse button be very responsive though like most of the other in it class they be not up to par with the top of the line in gaming mouse they lack the almost hair trigger response present in the like of the logitech and razer gaming mouse but this be certainly excusable a it come in price at nearly 14 those top model the center scroll button also move smoothly with no hitch or drag at all i typically prefer dpi switch with an up and down option but this mouse only have one button so you need to cycle through your setting to get what you re look for the accompany software work well to customize both the lighting and the dpi setting for the mouse on the down side the entire instruction manual be write in chinese only there be accompany picture but these be not really useful luckily you probably will not need the instruction not only be the mouse plug and play so you do not really need the software unless you want to customize the lighting or dpi even if you do choose to do so it pretty straight forward and you would not really need instruction in the first place it just worth mention so if you re not very computerinclined and always need instruction manual you re not go to like what you see overall the xm326 stay competitive with most offering in it price range but there be some that have superior sensitivity if you be not a gamer who demand the absolute high in mouse dpi setting and you like the overall style of this unit it make an excellent option 4000dpi be stoday i learnedl a reasonably sensitive gaming mouse i receive a discount on this mouse for my unbiased evaluation,Good

an aegis 20 be cheap and well for dataonly reason belowbut have one aegis 30 be well if desire highsecurity primary use with usbmounte app a explain below the aegis 30 secure usb drive have two minor glitch 1 for realequent shutdownsbut not with desktop and not if use the for realee fix see below 2 feel hot in use i do not know if this will affect longevity but where the 30 speed be not important the 20 be le costly and also seem more certain to last well either way i like the security of a physicallyencrypted portableapps firefox backup program and personal datum available for realee for realom the internetand no other usb stick be a secure might a well use it at home with the desktop a well a with the laptop when travelingso you do not have to adjust when suddenly leave then you be more secure for realom physical a well a viral induce failure pro for update and save a backup of blog pagesmy apricorn 30 take only 1015 second v 2060 second with my old apricorn 20 also with apricorn 30 there be no for realeezeup of the portableapps firefox during the download so the true comparison be 0 second v 3060 second wait with each operation also you can use a 20 usb port i can not explain thisbut with the apricorn 30 i notice an equal efficiency increase whether use a 30 or a 20 port small keychain size so you can easily carry 2 for autobackup with true security in case of loss or oldage failure a third copy should stay at home of course the two secondary backup can all be apricorn 20 selfdestruct sequence enable you to wipe the server instantly con onedrivegoogledriveamazondrive might be safe and more convenient especially for highmemory lowsecurity file such a home video etc the case of the apricorn aegis can be lose unless you tape on a you eyelet for a lanyard see photo attach you can then get a necklace lanyard at any walmart and thus make sure that the case stick with the stick put your email and telephone number on the caseusing the same clear tape with which you attach the eyelet for the eyelet i use the tough plastic for realom a piece of oldfashioned antenna wire with the two wire cut off the soft cord of the id necklace can be loop onto the handle of a handbag or samsonite and close with the apricorn stick either inside or outsidethus use without detachingthus unlikely to be forgot any external memory have the potenthanks in advancel for veryannoye for realequent shutdown if this happen there be two solution a save a folder of favorite photo on the usb driveand use they a your desktop backgroundand activate a slideshow with a 10second delay this seem effective in prevent the usb drive for realom fall asleep if you must use your laptop on batterythen perhaps use smallkb lowquality graphic or line drawing and deselect stop slideshow on battery power b andor google for the for realee app keepalivehddownload and install to the computerand set it to update a small text file on the external drive every 50 second complete detail below if you be james bond edward snowdon or hillary clinton you might need a much large apricorn usb memory otherwise most of your nonpersonal junk can probably be save on the standard onedrivegoogledriveamazondrive cloud memory if you be a doctor accountant or other professional with large amount of highsecurity information you probably can subscribe to a highsecurity cloud systemwhich will meet your legal requirement and will be a bit safe for realom be lose steal cook or smash in summary i suggest the apricorn usb system primarily for your veryown trulypersonal password credit card and other datum which you do not want identity thief china russia anonymous or the bengazzi committee to get ahold of detailed note on keepalive hdand other attempt to prevent repeat shutdown of aegis 30 so far a 10second desktop slide show seem equally effective in prevent shutdown rightclick on any window desktop personalize desktop background slide show picture location browse and select a folder on your usb drive with several photo in it change picture every select 30 second save change for great for realee pic find the get more theme online link near the top of the main personalize your desktop page after instal a theme the slide show page show the url location of the result pic copy the one you like good onto the usb drive if you need to reduce power usage then perhaps use any for realee image editor to reduce the physical size and the quality of the jpg image file so a to minimize the kb file size nosleephd10 be not successful in keep the apricorn aegis 30 awake on my hp stream notebook keepalivehd work good for i when set to write every 50 second i try 100 second so that le workload be be addedbut then the aegis 30 sometimes would shut down if 50 second be not enough try 30 second seem good not to select autorun at startup under setting autorun can cause confusion by try to write when the aegis be offline keepalive be start by click the check boxenable writing mode please note that both my desktop and my notebook use window 81 the aegis 20 have no problem keep awake with my desktop or my notebook the aegis 30 have no problem with my desktopit even keep awake all night during screen saver mode although not if the sleep mode kick in however by itself the aegis 30 do not keep awake with my hp stream notebook the aegis 30 also can be keep awake by play youtube video on the usbmounted portable firefox which be not idealand quite unfeasible with a metered or 4 g connection presumably it would also work to leave a browser tab open to a smalldownload javascript auto refor realesh tutorial demo page which can be set for 30 second or window itself can be program to open and close thing repeatedly or several for realee macro also can be program to copy and repeat any action such a write in and save a text filevery similarly to keepalivehd however keepalivehd be obviously the good method while available but so far the slide show

i ve use quite a few hard drive dock in the past and be somewhat picky despite this i find little to be picky about with this product the startech dock have a good weight to it and do not appear to be cheaply make a some dock do it sata port in drive bay 1 be line up properly so there be no trouble get the drive seat and it come with all necessary cable for both it ide and sata capability the product would easily merit five star if not for one small thing it would be nice to know that drive 2 can not be use for a second sata drive where the port would be for a second sata drive on most dualslot dock there be a foam pad to set the closed end of an ide hard drive while it be cable to the port on the back of the dock it seem a though it would have be easy to have a sata port there and a rubber plug which would serve the same purpose a the foam padding when the device be not in use this mean that if you have two sata drive you can not plug they both in simultaneously and transfer between they which will surely irritate i somewhere down the road ill be upload a user picture so that future buyer do not suffer this same disappointment but all in all the dock be well put together and worth add to your toolset,Good
pro it tiny the picture quality be actually pretty good well than i expect very easy to set up con the builtin software have most of the feature you would want or expect but it kind of perform like a very old and unreliable computer the netflix app will crash if you try to navigate too quickly it have crash about 4 time in the last 4 hour a few time in the interface and once during playback it impossible to select episode in the netflix browser for some reason it also difficult to find the actual play button through the netflix interface there be nothing that let you know when you ve actually highlight the play button you have to move around with the arrow and hit ok untoday i learned you land on it i ve also have youtube error with no explanation the only way to restart an app be to power off the device and turn it back on oh and netflix will not play at all in airplay mode for realom my iphone i think this product might get more and more annoying with time also the remote have no playback control what the fuck how convenient be it to browse youtube netflix etc with no pause play fast forward or rewind control on the remote minor oversight i would say overall it do not feel snappy or responsive like a roku amazon firetv or normal tv receiver it a lot more slow and old feeling while that may be nitpick a little bit in 2018 we be use to our device respond well and work well this software feel date and unreliable i m not sure yet if i will return it but if you plan to use hdirect messagei usb sd card for your playback the thing will be fine cheer edit after 6 month of use after buy several other projector and return they i have decide that this be actually the good tiny projector available on amazon the builtin wifi be not find in most other product and the other do not have the android software or app preinstalle a this one do so out of the box it repertoire of feature be pretty solid the fact that it can project for a few hour use build in battery instead of wall outlet give it a versatoday i learnedity not find in the other product that i try a well the travel size be unbeatable it exactly the same size a an iphone 6 or 7 or 8 plus although a bit thick i use it every night to watch movie to fall asleep on a 100 image and once you get use to the quirkiness of the software i really can not complain,Good

i do not stream or record a ton but this little guy really handy for quick and easy lighting if your monitor have usb port build into it the lighting while fain real lifey bright if stare directly into be not quite bright enough to distract i while grind out titfanfall 2 i read a review that dim do not work but that be not true after turn on the light you simply press and hold the same power switch and it switch to it dim set it boot on the bright setting by default when turn on,Good
the quality of the product be very good it be very well build and have a nice solid feel to it however they really need to do some more product testing on this the problem i have be with the location of the two usb port they be too low and close to the plug below if you have anything with a power block the size of the apple 12 watt power block or large you will have clearance issue between any cable plug into the usb port and what be plug into the outlet below it and in some case you will only be able to use one or the other that sort of defeat the purpose of be able to for realee up the plug by be able to plug usb cable directly without the power block a you can see for realom the picture i post you can not use the right usb port at all a the device i have plug in be parthanks in advancelly cover the usb port it be not even that big a you can see compare to the apple power block and the usb cable on the right be tightly butt up against the apple power block all belkin have to do be move the usb port up about 12 an inch and spread they out a little wide,Bad
i have to have the hdmi board in my onkyo receiver replace which i believe be due to heat buildup i do not want that to happen again especially now that it out of warranty and look for a good solution for cool i have be use a small box fan which provide plenty of air flow but i have to manually turn it off or on when i use the receiver life be hard i know with these cool fan plug into the receiver usb port they only turn on when the receiver be turn on they do not provide near a much air flow a my box fan but i be not expect they too i believe they provide adequate cooling however a the receiver do not get really hot like it use to tip for beginner some equipment put out power through the usb port all the time even when it turn off so if you want to have an automatic setup like mine make sure it do not power anything when turn off to test just plug in a tablet phone playstation controller or whatever when your unit be turn off and see if it start charge it if it do that mean these fan will be on all the time even with your unit turn off,Good
be an easy to assemble first build the for realont io cable be kind of ugly and the fan placement leave a void in my heart i could not ask for more for what i pay for would recommend i instal a diy power supply shroud to cover the ugly cable mess on the right side you ll most likely have,Good
blunt honest truth honestly think this deserve nothing le than a 4 it almost perfect so it should get an almost perfect score i m definitely more happy than unhappy and overall the company seem like they actually care about their product and be put effort and real thought into the design and usability of their product they re not an overnight knockoff like so many thing find around amazon in this category they re actually try to integrate usbc into a seemingly apathetic aesthetic world so kudos for the hard work the good durable aluminum feel solid well make usb30 typea female usb31 typec male very compact indicator ledlight minimalistic design color to match 2015 retina macbooks the bad unfortunately i have to agree with most of the review here the adapter do not lockin or make a secure connection with the receive female port so if you nudge or wiggle the adapter at all it will disconnect this of course just add all the more value to the integrate indicator ledlight too long did not read if you re go to use this an constantly be on the move it not go to work for you if you re sit at a desk with little to no move it ll work just fine,Good
i get this for my brand new 2016 macbook pro 15 with touchpad this adaptor fit snug enough and look great in the space grey color to match my macbook color some of you have a problem with the width of this adaptor i be able to use it next to the port i plug my power cable into with no space problem at all maybe you can not fit two of these adaptor sidebyside but with my macbook i have two more port on the other side of the computer and i could use another one of these adapter if i want to one on each side with other item next to they i have only have this adaptor a few day so i will certainly need to use it for awhile long before i can fully rate it performance hopefully it will not breakdown or anything like that but so far so good a neat little adapter that look great and be at a decent price i could of buy the white one for realom apple but i prefer the look of this one,Good
i buy this for my desk at work my previous small fan break i be on the look out for a fan that have an onoff switch my last fan do not have and that be adjustable in direction this fit the bill perfectly i buy a usb plug fan because i happen to have a multi port on my desk for such but otherwise would have be look for a regular plug which seem to be hard to find this fan be nice and quiet i can talk on the phone with my customer and have no issue with background noise except for coworker laughing out loud the cord be a decent length however if you be plug for realom under desk it may be an issue again not for i with the multi port on my desk the wind strength be reasonable it a comfortable breeze but not so much my hair be flip up but if i be force to say weak or strong i would have to say more on the weak side it can be adjust up to down in breeze direction easily with one hand this be also very light weight pro quiet smallunobtrusive easy to use very light con usb plug not traditional plug i do quite a bit of my shopping online particularly at amazon so like you i depend on review to be honest so i can make an informed decision all of my review be on product i purchase on amazon i have never review an item i do not personally buy on amazon so i hope this have be helpful for your shopping need if you have a question i will try and answer it to my good ability enjoy your shopping,Good
with our entertainment center relegate to the basement we need something for the livingdining room to play the morning news on the radio and the occasional background music for entertain light entertain be too old and babyhave to throw a big loud shindig i ve have a sangean atomic clock radio in the bedroom for a couple year and be very happy with it tuning performance so i want to see what sangean have in the way of music system i be momentarily sidetrack by the tivoli model one which sure be pretty but some radio geek on a blog swear up and down that the tivoli do not tune a well nor sound a good a the sangean wr2 essenthanks in advancelly the same a the wr22 minus bluetooth and i can not stand fight with an analog tuner to find a station plus you have to pay a lot more to get the bluetooth tivoli so then i consider the sangean wr12bt which offer a very simple retro analog tuner appearance somewhat like the tivoli i be worry my wife would not like all the blinky buttony ledy digitality of the wr22 out on display on the bar plus stereo sound and bluetooth although some people complain about the sound quality i end up order both and give they a listen at home it really come down to style and your desire for digital feature both radio sound very good in a medium living room the wr12bt do seem a bit bassheavy and muddle at first but turn the bass knob down and treble knob up a bit do the trick while the wr12bts woofer provide pretty good bass it well at the lowlow than the lowmid so song with funky bass line sound kind of thin the single 3 speaker of the wr22 on the other hand provide excellent bass lick in the lowmid range even after i turn the loudness set to off because for realankly it be a bit thick even though it could not reach the same lowlow a the 12bt yknow for your techno and hip hop switch quickly back and forth between the two on the same station the 12bt actually and strangely sound a bit small than the 22 at comparable volume probably because of the well midrange fidelity of the 22 the stereo sound of the 12bt be nice but the mono 22 sound great enough on it own that you do not really miss the stereo at least not for a casual background radio i think the 12bt be a good bit louder at max than the 22 but the 22 fill the room amply and i do not think ill ever be crank it to max anyway like i say be beyond that and unless you re a serious audiophile that be look for your primary music system and be ready to she will out several hundred buck for some other fancy system both the 12bt with tweak and the 22 sound great on their own if you be not listen to they sidebyside to figure out that one sound well for jazzclassical or the other sound well for rock you would never know what you re miss you d just think you get a pretty good shelf system for a very good price so if you want the handy feature of digital tune 5 memory preset a clock that handily set itself once you tune to a station broadcast rds and a remote control go with the wr22 if you want something that will look cool at your mad men party and you do not mind manual tuning with no preset get the wr12bt,Good
build qualityperformance i have the white version and it a simple well build hub nothing creak or bend when twist or apply pressure on it the white be a very glossy finish that attract fingerprint like crazy there be one blue lead at the top to notify that the hub be connect to the computer it have an attach usb 30 cable and 4 port on the top slide around your desk or workstation be not a problem since there be 4 nonskid foot at the bottom compare it to the usb 30 port directly and my other 2 usb 30 hub it barely have any difference between they if any compatibility it be able to connect any of my multitude of flash drive vary with different storage capacity and brand it be also able to connect my usb 30 portable hard drive i know some hub do not work with peripheral device ie mouse and keyboard i have my logitech mx anywhere mouse and logitech keyboard that work perfectly with the hub pro 4 usb port fast transfer rate compatible with logitech device backwards compatible with 20 usb port and device overall impression this hub play nice with my computer and all my device no problem at all it be definitely a hub i would recommend to people,Good

i have test this centon 32 gb usb 20 drive and compare it to it new fast usb 30 version they be fain real lifey well build but fall behind in performance compare to other usb 30 drive on the market nowadays the rule of thumb be that you should pay about 50 cent per gig and should only buy usb 30 since 20 be much slow i can not speak for reliability a i have not use they much i get mine for for realee after rebate elsewhere so figure i d test they and leave a review see the attach picture for my transfer speed test result both centon drive be test on window 7 and a usb 30 port usb 30 black read 99mbs write 27mbs usb 20 grey read 20mbs write 5mbs i would personally recommend buy the pny turbo usb 30 drive instead a it it super fast and reliable i have 128 gb version that i use all the time and could not be happy hope this help,Bad
reliable drive nice slider mechanism although a little large fast read speed but write speed could be well the old cmfsl364 gb be fast than the new b version of the drive corsair cmfsl3b64 gb crystaldiskmark benchmark usb 30read 1217mbswrite 2273mbs usb 20read 333mbswrite 134mbs,Good

i be skeptical at first about all the thing this device promise to do after use it a few day i be now convinced that this be the good portable travel companion for any road warrior and it be a must have for anyone that want to watch their video collection on their mobile device via external drive design this tripmate sith feel very solid although the casing she will be make of plastic it be a hard plastic that do not give away when you press around it or hold it in your hand there be a rubber wraparound on the top half around the device and you can peel it away to reveal the port very minimalistic design the black and red color scheme look awesome and fit the name so well also this thing be a lot small than i expect i ve include a picture of it next to two battery pack both of which pack 13000 mah and an iphone 6 it small than the other battery pack but stoday i learnedl manage to pack 10400 mah plus all the other thing that it do very well design functionality 1 na this be the most exciting feature because many device promise to make your ext hdd into a wireless drive but a lot of time it be hard to do the tripmate sith pair easily with my io and android device and i be able to view old video for realom my ext hard drive via their dedicated app the app for both io and android work really well they also have mac and window app for view your drive on a pc or mac there be no lag when play a video for realom the tripmate sith to my device and no diminish quality either the companion app also work like a charm 2 router and bridge this be also a smooth setup once you hook it up there be a place to access the administrative setting and change it accordingly to make your wireless connection secure which i really like bridging also be easy enough i believe this work nicely for travel purpose it a really interesting idea to use this during hotel stay when you may only have access to a wired connection you can simply plug this in and have a wireless internet connection 3 external battery this thing be a beast in that it pack a 10400 mah battery so you can bring this anywhere and charge your device since it small enough and discrete enough to fit in most small bagspurse comparison it hard to do this part of the review because i can not really find any product that be in the same ballpark hootoo really elevate itself by expand the battery storage to 10400 mah and i notice that they ve update their companion app to new one just a little while ago it seem that they be invest in this product and that s a great sign for the customer overall if you need something that can act a a na and want to have the option of have a router and bridge device then you can not go wrong with this and you get an ext battery inside too a quick amazon search show that hootoo be know to make pretty solid product base on customer review so you can trust that they will take care of any problem that you may have with this product during the use disclosure i be provide a for realee sample for review in exchange for an honest and fair review,Good

i get this product to use with my nexus 6p i currently have an array of additional charger mostly anker but most of they be micro usb of those some of they have hard wire cable and other would work with an new usba to usbc cable i want to essenthanks in advancelly convert my charger to usbc a easily a possible pro cheap cost not feel quality construction build to spec some of these device can harm your device but this pas the test checkr microusb end have a perfect fit you can hear and feel a click when plug in and it be solid con usbc end jiggle a bit the additional rigid length it add make it easy to accidently damage your charge port do not take advantage of high amp charger power iq tablet charger so like i mention these adapter be cheap to buy 2 to a pack and only 9 a well a the quality be stellar they be build to usbc spec and will not harm your device and the microusb end make a really solid connection though the usbc end jiggle a bit the add rigid length that it add worry i that the weight exert on the charge port especially use a heavy cable can cause the port to wear out fast since it the fulcrum be stationary but the length increase it also make use the phone while charge a bit more annoying now to the part i care the most about with this adapter you i find various charge speed typically max at 12 amp though the charger support more use my tablet charger which charge any typical microusb device between 213 amp it only charge the 6p with the adapter at 1 amp use an anker poweriq charger which give out 21 amp to a microusb device when it be the only thing plug in only charge at 12 amp it really get funky with old anker charger which have separate android and iphoneapple port there i find that it charge at a max of 12 on the android and a max of 750 mah on the apple port but sometime it would require be unplugged and plug back in to the android port to get the max all in all i say buy it it convert all your charger quickly and cheaply for the amount of charger i have ill need an extra 2 and will be able to leave an adapter on permanently due to the minor con and the fact that you lose the ability to take advantage of fast charger i m deduct 1 star i receive the product for for realee in exchange for my thorough and honest review edit i end up buy more to convert all my cable and charger it be work out great for these past 4 month but the adapter and the lengthrigidity it add just bother i not go to deduct star a it not a bad product just personally annoying for charger that i use on a daily basis or when i m charge and use the phone,Good
fit nice and have potenthanks in advancel if it have a few more basic option it do not display the picture and name of the song you be play if you use a cd it will show the name i notice when i change setting or go back to the home screen it pause like it processing for a sec or two i plug my usb charger into the unit and attach my iphone once i select the usb option the screen go blank then blue i turn my car off and the unit stay on untoday i learned i disconnect the power and ground wire the interface be cheesy but again it be a 60 unit the sound and power for realom it be good for the price honestly once i make my mind up on what headunit i want next i m sell this thing,Average
ill say this be easy to use literally plug and play plug the usb into a computer usb port to transfer movie then plug into your io device if you have the app great if you do not it will prompt you to download the app the user interface be pretty intuitive and graphical see first pic so you can select the storage source etc the app even have other medium streaming app like youtube and vimeo i do notice while load some low quality mp4 file for realom the drive there be inithanks in advancel lag for realom time to time but it recover well and do not stutter once it start because this be a chargingsync cable it can be use to chargesync while play video which be pretty neat i only wish the cable be long because you if you charge and watch the phone have to be next to the power source i mean i like that it small so when it not use for syncingcharge it take up very little room however because it so small it easy to lose already misplace it once overall i like this device but decide to deduct 5 star because of the intermittent video lag and 5 star for size a it so easy to lose and can make chargingsyncing challenge 45 star,Good
good quality quick charge work great and be nice and long for the desk wish it be usb 30 but the price would be much high if that be the case buy it nice quality,Good
this be a very fun and easy way to take a close look at the world around you even the most mundane thing be interesting under this microscope my wife and i be grow adult but we be entertain for several hour just run around the house and find thing to examine in fact this be probably the cool toy i have have since i be a kid i do not expect much for realom the software since it be usually an afterthought on item like this and often not even worth download but i be very pleasantly surprised to find that it be simple stable and useful the include stand be nice but keep in mind that you will not get very much magnification unless the object be basically press against or even situate inside the clear ring on the end of the microscope if you try to use it like the display picture show with the microscope several cm above the object it be more of a magnify glass than a microscope a other reviewer note the focus wheel can be hard to understand i finally decide that the good way to focus be to get the object in position against the clear ring and then just rotate the focus wheel all the way through it range of motion the image will come into focus not once like a normal camera but twice at two different level of magnification it be pretty easy to find the two different focused image since everything in between be just complete blur the led light be nicely diffused and by adjust it carefully you can make the good of the admittedly low budget webcam image sensor the camera adjust to the light automatically so that the brightness of the image do not change much except at the extreme but you can increase the clarity and take some noise out by get the lighting right my only gripe with this thing be that i hate the capacitive touch button it be almost impossible to hold the microscope steady and adjust the focus without accidentally trigger the capacitive touch button about 15 time it would be nice if there be an easy way to disable it picture command strip similar to velcro beard hair stamp key,Good
purchase this unit a a high upgrade to an old netgear modem router and highly recommend it to anyone that be on dsl or want to use it a a router speed and performance be quick and connection be solid the unit can also have portable usb hard disk connect and use a a file server to share file in your network there issue with dnla however in which the d9 can not read avi or mp4 video file just yet the other thing that s miss be automatic quality of service qos which can affect quality when use streaming service such a netflix hulu or amazon prime video tp link be work to address the issue and hopefully will be resolve soon,Good

this power strip have be work out well for i i have be use it for a few week i like the nice bright color have the usb port trim in green seem to help i find an open spot fast the cord be just long enough to give i a little bit of room to work with it but not be a long mess like some other strip it also wrap up nicely when i be do use it i like that this strip offer six usb where some other model only offer four not only because of the extra port but this give someone with big hand room to pull the plug out by plug in one skip the next port and then plug in the bottom while i have not try all six at once i have have my phone and tablet charge while use a third to power a dashcam to set up the menu with no issue i also like that the the back of the strip be smooth this allow i to apply a piece of 3 m dual lock tape to it and then to a table in a hotel to keep it for realom slide around then when i be do the dual lock pull right off of the table and strip with no issue i have a little trouble at first get the universal power outlet to accept a u plug but get it after a bit of a push the only downside for i be that the strip do not seem to fast charge my samsung phone regardless if i use a usb port or my stock charger and cable in the outlet plug i also wish it have a small led to let i know when it be off or on there be an off and on button but it just press and click in so if it be on the floor you might not be able to tell if it be off or on before plug something in other then that i be pretty happy with it it be also a nice bonus that the package be so easy to open i receive this outlet at a discount price in exchange to take an honest look at it,Good

they squeeze a lot of feature in this tiny dash cam i ve want to add a dash cam to my car for some time i ve hear that it can come in handy and serve a extra protectionevidence in the event of an insurance claim the vantrue x3 catch my eye with it slim profile and robust feature my goal be to install a dash cam that s out of sight hide for realom my line of vision and work automatically the vanture x3 do just that and very well although there be a few shortcoming i m give this product a full 5 star and it meet my need in every way stoday i learnedl ill break down some observation that maybe can be use a improvement for the next version featuresbenefit even the packaging be well think out and high quality have a premium feel to it wifi able to easily connect the cam to your phone via app for live view and file transfer various recording mode personally i keep mine on the default loop option can switch between 1 3 or 5 minute interval various resolution setting all the way up to 4k it amaze i that a device this small can capture so much this make it easy to capture all the detail such a license plate street sign etc i set mine to record at 1080p at 60fps to capture more for realamesmotion and save more space per file compare to 4k video and audio be both crisp and clear night vision also work great many setting include time lapse auto shut off gravity sensor park mode and more this dash cam be very versatoday i learnede cam easily disconnect for realom the mount with the push of a button this allow you to hide the camera out of plain sight when not in the car to avoid breakintheft great form factor small and lightweight i be able to mount the camera directly behind my rearreview mirror i now do not see it when i drive which be prefer a i do not want a distraction support up to 128 gb memory card not include make sure you have one or buy with your purchase of this dash be sure to format with first use clean installation do not need to worry about a cable dangle for realom the car celle obstruct your view vanture provide a long 10 ft charge cable this allow i to guide and hide the wire inside the weather stripping of my car all the way down the glove box underneath the floor mat and ultimately into the charge port a passenger will not notice the wire unless they know to look for it youtube hide your dash camera wire for reference picture of my hidden wiring attach automatic turn on when i power on the car record continue clip when i drive and turn off after i reach my destination and power off the car this be exactly what i want flawless observationsareas of improvement the charge use mini usb not micro usb micro usb have become the standard in most smart phone if this dash cam have a micro usb port i could have use an exist cable charger in my car instead of need to add another the include charger be too bulky for one of my dc location so i have to move some thing around to make it work take a little bit of time but now all be well advice for next version switch to micro usb and include a 10 ft cable that easily detach for realom the charge port if a user already have a 234 port charge they can then plug in the cable to the charger they currently have a other have suggest gps functionality require an extra module sell separately it would be great if this feature can be build in for the next version this would allow the cam to record car speed and location information which could come in handy if an incident occur mount appear sturdy but it be possible for the joint mount to loosen over time i suggest carefully position where you want it and then leave it a be the more you move it around the high the chance of it loosen a potenthanks in advancel for concern vanture be aware of this and create an upgrade mount to prevent this issue there be only an option of the windshield mount it would have be nice if a stick dash mount be a possibility but i actually now prefer the windshield option since i be able to guide and hide the wiring while the video record in hduhd the screen be low resolution in comparison this be expect for such a small device while the dash cam provide the convenient option to view the video direct form the device the recording will look much clear on phone via wifi app or computer in summary this be an amazing dash cam for the price and while no piece of technology be perfect the minor shortcoming i discover do not negatively affect my use of the dash cam now that the dash come be set up everything function well than expect if you be in the market for a dash cam the vanture x3 should be highly consider,Good
i m update my review to reflect that the vendor sunvalleytek have be in communication with i to resolve some of the security issue i m happy to report that with their late firmware 20052 it provide an option to disable discoverability on the wan port so no port be open to the wan side of the network which be awesome a this prevent attacker for realom establish a connection to the administrative console make sure you update the firmware and when you do you may notice that the firmware build number stoday i learnedl show the old firmware on the admin console i do not think they include the new build number into the bin file however if you go into your wifi setting you ll see the new feature the only improvement i d like to see on the device be the ability to save ssid connection info such that you do not have to enter your access point share password each time you reconnect otherwise the add security be much improve good job sunvalleytek original review i be hesitant after read the review about the security issue of the device one review mention the old linux kernel that be be use and another review mention that telnet be open i have hope the device would provide some add bit of security when connect to untrusted network after configure the filehub i scan the external interface outside the filehub local network i be shocked to find several security issue 1 the web management console be available on port 80 and 81 this device default to an admin account what s the point of lock down telnet if you can just a easily bruteforcedictionary attack on the management console in the same manner i expect at minimum the web management console would be available to just those user that be already part of the fileplus local network a it be if you connect this device to your hotel network you risk someone authenticate to the device with the admin account your datum on the sd card etc be at an elevated risk 2 no tl certificate all traffic in plaintext in essence this be no different then have telnet open there s just no way i would use this in any environment such a a hotel especially for a tech conference 3 samba port open on the outside network a well the issue be communicate with the vendor that they need to push out an update that close these port on the external interface after the user perform the inithanks in advancel setup accessible only for realom the inside network after several punt by their customer service team it finally their technical team their recommendation be use a strong password garbage do not buy if you value the privacy of your datum or think that you re get add security with this,Good

i pair this with 2 850 evo 500 gb ssd over usb 31 gen 2 in raid 0 and get great speed be on the fence between go with this product or get a 4bay enclosure for a raid 5 configuration decide to go with the miniprolower overall cost and fast speed will be back up file onto a local na primary use this setup for fcp x editing on a 27 5 k imac 2017 35 ghz 40 gb ram also run win10 boot camp on a single external 850 evo 500 gb via the minipro 25 sata to usb 31 usbc overall i m pretty happy with the result not a fast a apple internal ssd would be but fast nonetheless p the cable that ship with the product specially the usbc to usbc provide great result,Good

pro fast speed than usb 20 good build quality slide up cap con not the fast drive available usb plug be expose slightly large than most other drive i be look for a usb drive to replace the one that i have originally lose and could not find i just want a drive that would be able to work reliably and be able to store most of my common file that i work between pc after much consideration i decide to buy a usb 30 instead of a 20 since they have drop price a lot and they be start to become mainstream in the new laptop see a most of my file total around 20 gb i decide to go for a 32 gb this kind of prove tricky because of the large selection on amazon for realom name brand to totally unknown company after much thought i decide to buy this pny usb 30 turbo thought it not the fast drive available but it work well that it be the good budget usb drive design the design look like most of the pny drive that have recently come out it a device make entirely out of plastic so do not expect premium detail like aluminum but for all intent and purpose it be sturdy and feel like it will last it be not one of those flash drive with a cap but it do have a cover that slide across the drive the benefit of this be that the port itself will probably remain protect for realom most physical damage but the drawback be that the usb connector might collect dust and will probably get damage if it come in contact with thing like sand and water but at a budget price these kind of thing be to be expect the size of the device itself be small and portable but it should be note that it be big than it 20 sible the pny compact attache 20 stoday i learnedl it should fit it most people pocket or pc without take up much room performance this be probably where most consumer will ask the question be usb 30 well than usb 20 in one simple answer yes by how much well it depend on the drive the pny turbo be a speedy device but there be fast drive on a positive note there be also slow drive out there a well however this pny turbo completely knock out the pny attache 20 out of the water in most of the benchmark on crystaldiskmark 403 it beat the old usb 20 by a wide margin typically more than 80 mb in read and more than 50 mb in write on the practical side of performance file load much fast on the pny turbo in some case almost instantly this will be noticeable in most if not all file transfer to and for realom the drive especially with program and huge hd video sure there be a couple drive that be clearly fast but for the price it hit a nice middle ground to work with one thing to note though the drive will get warm when it be in use this be something that i ve never experience with the old usb 20 but i have hear that it be common with usb 30 conclusion be this the good drive on amazon for most people it be it be practical and reasonably quick for what you re pay especially when compare to the old usb 20 standard if your concern be absolute speed the sandisk ultra extreme 30 or the lexar jumpdrive p10 will probably fit your need well if you want the absolute cheap drive possible there be countless drive with the same storage amount but with a low price tag include the pny compact attache 20 however i would strongly encourage you to spend a little extra and get the pny turbo 30 why because here in 2015 at the time of this writing more computer be come out with at least one usb 30 even the cheap chromebook have they a well even if you be not concerned about speed or transfer large file it would provide a way of future proof your device and allow you to spend more time work rather than wait for file to transfer and load for i it be a good purchase and i hope it last a long time at least throughout college,Good
i buy this for my canon camerasd card to use with my 2009 macbook pro it fit perfectly in the usb port and my sd card fit in perfectly a well note my sd card be also transcend brand there be also a micro sd port which i plan on use with the microsd i use in my gopro when plug in the adaptor blink blue the adaptor appear on my desktop dropbox ask if i want to save the photo to dropbox and the photo app open and ask if i want to import the photo i love this adaptor because my computer recognize it a a camera not just a usb drive you do not have to drag and drop or copy and paste everything it be a quick transfer of my picture too there only very minor issue i have be open the package be not a easy a the perforate edge make it seem it do not tear perfectly along the edge packaging be not a big issue for i which be why i give this product 5 star what i would suggest for the next version cover for the sd and microsd port there be a cover on the usb port so it do not get damage but the sd and microsd port be open and could easily get dirty inside and damage those port,Good

nix x18b 185 inch digital photo almost perfect first i must say i just love nix digital photo for realame because they turn off when not in use save a lot on the electric bill while give i the convenience of never have to change photo behind a glass for realame i use 2 gb sd card for all my nix for realame a the tiny usb flash drive that come with it seem to get pretty hot over time i use videosecu ml12b vesa mount modify with brass spacer cut with dremel cutter so i can mount they right to the shelf instead of the wall see photo my only complaint be that i wish the for realame be 43 format instead of the 169 where a lot of my photo have to be crop and resize so they would look right on this display the other two for realame be 15 inch 43 format normal setting so i do not have to do any cropping they almost look big than the 18 inch when i first start look at nix for realame i originally want wifi type so i could just send the photo right to the for realame for realom my computer but now with all the hacking i see that a a potenthanks in advancel security risk,Good
this thing come with an absurd amount of feature pretty much all the feature you could get for realom it big brother be somehow cramp in here so much so that they have to go vertical with daughter board like for the vrm and audio the socket be centralize and the back of the motherboard do not have any interference for noctua cpu air cool backplate overall a good motherboard but it do have some key difference for realom the vii impact that seem like bizarre change to i this motherboard come with asus new fan header extender card allegedly they re make it a stand alone product later on the previous maximus vii impact come with a solution unique to this motherboard that allow for more fan header directly on the motherboard this new solution may make sense on large motherboard but i think be terrible for mini itx the extender board have to be mount somewhere it have to be connect to the motherboard with a very long cable and require a molex power connector the manual do not even mention it existence good luck get it mount anywhere on your mini itx case i end up just use a fan splitter cable be much simple and take up le space m2 be replace by u2 u2 be pretty much dead and even if it be not make no sense for a mini itx board again they for some reason choose the le compact and simple solution that would make more sense for an atx board but not for a mini itx board the maximus vii impact have a pretty great m2 mount solution that allow it to be mount sideways on the for realont of the motherboard most other mini itx motherboard put it in the back which make it very hard to manage once your build be complete in your case it would ve make more sense for they to include two m2 connector one in the for realont like in the maximus vii and one in the rear of the board this would ve be great for enthusiast look to take advantage of samsungs ultra fast never minde drive one for oscore program one for game no need for 25 drive and the extra cabling that come with that the u2 connector also remove space away for realom the rear io due to it location this mean that be miss the usb 20 and ps2 stack that be present in the maximus vii impact this board rear io could ve really use that since there s a rather low count of usb port with one of they be a type c connector i have a nexus 6p which use that but i do not see myself need to connect my phone to my pc on regular enough basis that i do not just use my adapter to hook up to my case for realont usb 30 port for simplicity asus this be an enthusiast board it a mini itx board you must consider both when update it in the next version it really feel like the mini itx aspect of this board be forget when design this board,Average

i will begin by say i be provide this item at a discount for my honest opinion i be not pay or affiliate with this company at all now on to the review the marchpower apple iphone lightning cable be nearly the perfect replacement for your apple brand cable the reason i say nearly will be explain later the cord itself be make with premium copper wire for fast data transfer and be wrap in a nylon braid it be a usb 20 datum synccharging cable for your iphone that mean you can charge the phone a well a use it to sync with your pc it be twice a long a the regular apple brand cable and feature aluminum housing on the usb plug and the lighting port in the package you will get two cable for the price everything i have mention be ask i anythingzing at the time of this review the 2 pack be right around 10 the cable be high quality and do exactly what they be mean to do without break the bank there be one one thing i do not like and it the reason i say this be nearly the perfect replacement the lighting header be just a little bit big than the stock apple one so if you have a lifeproof be aware of that depend on the generation of lifeproof it may or may not fit same go for other case it may or may not fit it get fine in my clear spigen case and if you do not use a case or you use a very minimalistic case or one with a big opening for the charge port you should be good to go i post a picture to show they difference in size of the two cord that s my only complaint and that be completely dependent on your case so just be aware of that otherwise for around 10 you really can not go wrong here,Good
i find this small tower case incredibly lightweight you can pick it up with one fingerof course that be before you load it up with all up amazon have this case for a mere 20 buck during the black for realiday week i should have buy more but a we always say next time this be a simple case black in color clean line but have a tight fit inside especially around the hard drive bay if you install a processor copper cooler with dual fan then you well install the hard drive first because that cooler will be in the way of those drive a you can only install they internally and not through the for realont of the case it allow for 4 pci or pcie card slot depend on your motherboard it come with two internal fan a 120 mm fan in the for realont and a 80 mm in the back i would suggest change out the rear fan with a 92 mm fan for well air circulation also this case do support those liquid processor cooler such a the corsair h60 or h70 this will avoid the need for those copper cooler which be large and bulky i recommend this case for all those who build computer on a budget,Good

the bos audio receiver replace my 13 year old ford sport trac stock receiver i love my sport trac but that old radio system be sorely out of tech date for my listening need this relatively inexpensive update to my vehicle do the trick of update my outdate audio tech so that my family and i can enjoy the thing we want listen to without alway have to resort to always use cd with a bit of know how a few tool and some internet search i be able to install the bos receiver myself for realom the old harness i cut out only the wire i need for realom a diagram i find on the internet and splice they up with the new wire the only drawback with the sport trac be that there s no way to properly anchor the receiver the previous receiver have wedge anchor hold in place for realom the side the bos receiver do not have this feature so right now the receiver slide back and forth for realom it slot untoday i learned i can find a well solution my dad want to use duct tape laugh out loud no while i m not wholly sell on the fancy lighting bling i do like that i now have update tech flexibility in my vehicle audio system i now can stream music for realom my smartphone via bluetooth expand my listen library immensely i stoday i learnedl have full access of my favorite am fm radio station the cd drive work great i ve plug in music for realom a thumb drive into the usb slot and the receiver immediately find the music and start play it the unit have an aux input a well i notice that the little protective door that cover the usb open a bit crooked when open see this i think that door would interfere with the usb for realom plug in properly but it have not be a problem make i wonder if intentional or not there be no jiggling or looseness to the little door it seem that be the way the little door swing open and there s no adjust it sound wise i be very pleased the music sound clean crisp and loud the eq preset be helpful to get the sound just right the bos receiver do come with a small remote that i can not help but think will be lose soon enough unintentionally sadly i do not see much use for it a it be since the radio be within my hand reach backseater would likely appreciate the remote more overall i be very pleased with the radio function and quality i be not crazy about it look or the constantly change light the fit be not perfect but not bad either,Good

update there be new software available for this drive that let you completely eliminate the virtual cd great for those that do not like it pop up all the time the drawback be that the virtual cd be require for drive encryption pro fast firewire 800 work with most mac sleek design unique status display work well low power low heat and well ventoday i learnedate con intrusive wd smartware software plastic construction instead of aluminum verdict this hard drive work flawlessly so i give it 5 star despite the intrusive software a nice external hard drive with some unique feature but the intrusive software might bother some user there be not a lot of choice for firewire 800 drive for mac user and this be certainly a sound offering with about twice the performance of the usb 20 connection performance do some file write by drag large file and folder to the hdd the usb 20 write time average about 35 mb and the firewire 800 transfer time be about 63 mb so it be definitely worth use firewire 800 over usb 20 power consumption be low and the drive be reasonably quite it have no loud fan but you do hear regular hard drive noise usage why be the software intrusive wd decide to use a virtual cd that mount whenever the hard drive be mount also use of their wd smartware program be require to use the drive they do provide a tool to disable their software on some drive but that do not work on the my book studio drive the drive be easy to setup and come preformatte a o x journale all i have to do be change a couple setting so the wd smartware software would not open every time the drive mount and change the label on the display on the drive to what i want i use it a a time machine drive which be setup by run time machine and select the my book drive a the backup drive,Good
this be a really nice hub that do not need external power the button on top be a great feature that allow you to activate and deactivate device plug in which be the main reason i select this hub a blue light also give you a visual cue of which device be active it work good with input peripheral such a keyboard and mouse but it do not play very well when you have an external ssd attach to it maybe the ssd require more power or bandwidth i m use a pretty decent macbook pro that have a usb 3 bus and i think since this be a 30 device that it should be able to handle demand task but in my experience it can make the ssd unavailable when transfer a big amount of datum because an error i also plug my samson studio gt active studio monitor with usb audio interface to it at the same time and the audio become erratic after a while when i stop use it and plug the device directly they work fine so i can assure you the problem be not with the device my conclusion be that this be a good hub for regular task but might fall short on demand task i might try a wired version of it if i find it maybe that would help thank you for read if you have any comment please post they,Good

i like the idea of these wall charger to save my outlet be fill with adapter i purchase these a they have good review and a reasonable price pro decent density of outlet color look nice ul listed con the surge protector do not come with a center screw this mean every time you go to unplug something for realom the outlet there be a good chance the whole assembly will come off the wall this be a 5 cent part that they just decide not to ship not sure if i just have a bad seller or this be how the product come but every other unit i have like this for realom other manufacturer or seller come with it the usb port be not mount mount well i ve find if a usb cable do not go in exactly straight when do it ever even a tiny amount of pressure will push the usb female end back into the unit after wiggle the cable in i ve find it not to be charge unless you pull the cable back out and in again base upon the con i would not recommend this product amazon have other wall usb surge protector for a few buck more that will be sturdy and come with the complete equipment need to use the product that be say it do work and be ul list,Bad
the metal chassis be an excellent improvement over the plastic chassis find on other xkeys panel the unit have a solid feel and allow i to play much more confidence in the longterm operator on the unit than the small plastic panel the include foot to elevate the rear of the panel be also very useful unfortunately the backlight bleed be stoday i learnedl quite an issue it can be rather difficult to distinguish which key be illuminate if you be in a normally light environment a it tend to bleed into the surround key the key cap also have a tendency to pop off occasionally which degrade the use experience quite a bit tip if your application rely on backlight key print your label on overheadtransparency sheet to allow the light to more easily pas through,Good
a many other reviewer have show this drive be not the good on construction a eventually the cap on both end and even the datum board will start fall apart nothing seem to be glue at the factory so if you do not mind eventually glue thing together i think it be stoday i learnedl worth the price this thing be tiny and the plastic be nice and rigid so it be durable when assemble data transfer speed be very fast this be the fast usb drive i have own yet and it be hard to beat the price tag for a 32 gig drive it be recognize very quickly by the computer so you do not have to wait a couple minute to use your drive despite the come apart i would stoday i learnedl buy another one of these drive and would recommend it to other,Good

i do a fair amount of research try to find the right dash cam for i i have a list of feature i wanteddidnt want inithanks in advancelly i want a 2cam system but it seem that the technology available to rival have two singlecam unit i decide to only get one cam to see how i like the whole dashcam thing and be very pleased with my decision pre purchase concern the wedge shape inithanks in advancelly i want a more discreet cam and feel that the wedge be both nondiscreet and sort of ugly the camera just look big and bulky i be really surprised with he small this camera be it tiny tiny the cam easily fit in the palm of my hand and i can almost close my hand around itoh i have normal sized hand i really can not oversell how little this thing be with it be so small the wedge shape actually do not bother i a much when attach to my windshield you do not realise that the thing be shape like a wedge because it conform with the angle of my windshield the screen i want my cam to be small and discreet so a screen be something i be not interested in typically screenless cam have a mobileapp you can use i wish the sg9665gc be screenless but this be not a big deal at the end of the day separate gps module i absolutely want gps and think it be odd that gps be include but a a separate module that plug into the cam on one hand i can no appreciate have it a a separate module because it reduce the size of the cam and let you put the gps somewhere else on the other hand it be just one more wire i have to deal with during installation ultimately i be glad they make the gps unit a a separate module it allow the cam to stay super small and let i position the gps wherever i want for good reception a a side note i do do the gps modification that flip the gps gut upside down so that you can mount the gps module to your windshield without reception issue this be super easy and video can be find online explain how i do wonder why street guardian do not just have it configure like this by default lack of swivelpivotrotate once position the cam lense can swivel to point more up or more down i be concerned about not be able to also turn the cam leave or right or be able to rotate it to point inside the car if i want it to once the cam be instal and i get to witness the huge field of view the leftright swivel be not a big deal i do wish the camera or it mount allow for the ability to rotate to see inside the car but this be not a big deal the cam basically just point in one direction one mount but you get a very wide field of view what i like price point for the feature include i really feel that this cam be outstanding there be some other popular cam that cost double what i get the sg9665gc for that look cool but do not really provide anything well picture quality it great the sony sensor really be the good out there right now and there s very little i can complain about it be very bright and overcast yesterday so the sky be a little wash out at time when drive towards the sun but this do not seem to be a fault with the camera but more a result of harsh condition video at night seem to be very good there be some cam that seem to do a little well in this department but i think the sg9665gc stoday i learnedl perform very well here and overall the day night quality be exceptional size like i say before this thing be small i have it mount next to my rear view mirror and it barely noticeable for realom the outside i think people who see it might actually thing it be something other than a cam because it so small fast bootup the cam indicate that it recording before my stereo start play usually it recording before i have start back out of my driveway i doubt they can get this thing record any fast package goody the sg9665gc come load with stickie mount wiring and everything you will need to get this thing up and run the cigarette adapter 12v to miniusb 5v cord be chop up when i hardwire my cam to my car i cut the cigarette adapter side of the cord off solder a inlinefuse 5amp wire to the positive cable of the cigadapter blackground redpos and connect that to a switch 12v line my sunroofor realainsensor control box i attach the ground wire black of the cigadapter to a ground in my car and i be good to go anyone who do this be obviously do this at your own peril the cigadapter wiring be very long almost too long i end up have to hide a lot of cable in my headliner but this be easy to do and i d rather have more cable than i need than not enough what i do not like what should be change the gps wire be exceptionally long and it come with a very short extension cable i do not understand the point of such a tiny extension cable it would be nice if the gps cable detach entirely for realom the unit and you could attach just the small cable in my install the gps and cam be right next to each other and the foot of gps cable have to be hide in the headliner error notification if the cam start without a memory card in it there be an error message that stay up for a few moment but there be no audible notification in my install the cam be to the right of my rear view mirror so that when i m drive i can not actually see the cam if there be ever a problem with the cam or memory card i most likely will not know there should really be an option to have constant beeping if there be an error this could be do in a firmware update and could be disabledenable via the menu lack of an appwifi it slightly annoying have to remove the memory card if i want to view the video it unlikely that a firmware update will allow for wifi in the future no wifi hardware but v3 might consider include this option the microsd slot be impossible to use with your finger this be one of those push in to pop the card out type of slot the problem be that the slot be just too small to press the memory card in with your finger i end up have to use a small coin to press on the memory card to insert and release the memory card a small gripe in the grand scheme of thing just an annoyance the cam 5v requirement i cut up the cigadapter cable in my hardwire installation because it include the circuitry that convert my car 12v supply to 5v for the camera the issue be that i now no long have a cable i can use for the camera in another car the cam be removable for realom it mount allow you to take it with you in another card there be easy way around this get a microusb cord and a generic cigadapter but it would have be helpful if the camera body include the 12v5v circuitry the main driver for my purchase be that the picture quality be report a be one of if not the good on the market what good be a dashcam if the picture be not good enough other review cite that this product be very wellmade and that customer service be great i can not speak for the customer service but the cam be absolutely solid and pack full of feature for the price it seem like a steal and i plan on get another sg9665gc v2 for my rear cam and for my wife car,Good
technology today be simply amazing this little datatraveler hold 8 gb of file and image it so small i m glad it have a hole in it to affix it to my car key or i d probably lose it simply incredible technology and to think ibm 1401 be so big it almost take up an entire room and only hold 4 kb of memory that s kb not mb and certainly not gb today we can carry more datum than could be store in multiple 1960 datum center on our key ring,Good

this review be for the ac3100 pcie wifi adapter there be some confusion in these review because it seem that all wifi card and even some usb wifi adapter it would seem sell by this vendor currently and even some past card share the same reviewsessenthanks in advancelly render the rating system useless but that s a discussion for another time after only play with this card very briefly have about an hour and the gin real lifefor realiend want to go out i be not very impressed installation be easy there be no inithanks in advancel driver issue that other have experience because most of they seem to reference a usb adapter and not this card i just plug the card into an open pcie slot pop in a thumb screw thread the 4 plug cord for the antenna base into the back and start my computer put in the driver disc and run the setup it work great right away with google and speedtestnet it get about 100mbps download and 14 upload with 810ish ping i should mention my internet be cap at 120mbps so i do not think 100 have much more room to grow in the real world this be pretty good but it be almost exactly the same a i be get with a netgear ac1200 adapter that be le than half the price i play a little rocket league and my ping be almost identical to the netgear adapter never drop below 68 one strange issue be that i always notice the first game of rocket league after start the game be very very pingy usually about 100150 ping even back when it be a wired connection with this new adapter it get much much bad for the first game around 300 i try go straight to asus website and redownloade the new driver and it make it much much bad i could only get sub 10 to 10 mbps download and rocket league become unplayable so reinserte the driver disk and repair the driver now i can get 60109 download and around 14 upload i m go to try move my router tonight and see what happen since the 2 different adapter be similarly iffy i understand they will not be a wired connection but 68 ping just start to give rocket league moment where it feel like it affect gameplay the antenna base seem nice and high quality big than expect and show in the picture the heat sink be sexy but face down in the case just like video card and the back be somewhat ugly seem high quality in material though i will update after play around some more and move the router i never do try the card again after move my router it turn out to be a more complicated scenario than i think i could not just move it to a different coax jack i end up discover that in my rental home there be cat 5 cable pull that be just dangle behind the coax wall plate so i go out and spend 15 on wall plate with cat 5 jack and 30ish on an ethernet switch and use it all to replace all the moronic and useless coax jack with active ethernet jack this house w build in 2016 why in god name would you need any coax jack let alone one in every room also i get wifi be what everyone want but for a stationary device such a a desktop or smart tv why would you add complexity to a system that do not need it by use wifi plug that baby in now i m wire and the internet be all mine palpatine voice infinite powaaaa my 100 card sit in my pc disable,Average

update the motherboard be awesome the on board wifiaudio etc be all very satisfactory but i m leave the star at 4 i have a lot of inithanks in advancel issue all relate to memory i see other experience similar issue with msiotherbrand some of the issue be solve with bios update i find a lot of solution at msi forum yet i stoday i learnedl can not get xmp with this mobo the bios update pace should have be fast so feel for realee to consider this a 5star review too it just 4 star right now to nudge msi a bit pro no thrash msi hardware killer stuff aside for realom the marketing the lanwifi be intel sound be realtek solid component pcb heatsink wifi there be few itx motherboard some do not have wifi they all should nicely market audio although the chip be realtek they make sure the quality be high and the sound be a clean a possible no dragon stamp con the io shield be too thick for my corsair 380 t i be lucky no pcb component chip off during my experiment there be also a tab on the io shield that go into the usb really really lucky check the component with a loupe they all seem to be perfect i ve hear complaint about the m2 sizing but since i skip m2 myself not an issue for i mod remove the io shield padding either insert it directly or sandpaint it for well look with the padding remove there be no sizing issue i end up remove the padding and clean the padding adhesive only suggestion do not install msi software you do not have to i ve research a lot after buy especially the msi network software should be avoid it generally because the entire network to slow down to a halt which be unbelievable but easily observable you can google it this be why i try to avoid msi however i be relieve this motherboard have intel network component so just instal intel driver should result in a cleanrobust system touch the usb socket etc before you grasp the motherboard so esd risk be minimal it well to unload electrostatic to the ground although i grind myself i also do this before touch the motherboard general lga115 be pretty challenging to insert be careful it look easy but it pretty stressful photo one of they be to show how tiny itx motherboard be they look big in the photo the other one be to show that the padding be removable info it come with 2 different sata 3 cable one of they be 90 degree angle it a good idea to buy some sata cable i will update this review when i actually complete building i just want to put the io shield issue out there so people will not risk damaging pcb component there be 23 small component that might get damage if one try to push the mobo into that hefty io shield,Good
this review be for the charger only this be a charger for sony bx1 battery it have dual slot so that you can charge two battery at once power be supply via a micro usb port it come with a cable but you ll need your own usb power adapter i ve try standard and apple adapter and both work about the same compare to the sony acctrdcx charger it a little thick but also shorter it weigh 24 gram compare to 14 gram for the oem charger the charge time be about the same use a 2a adapter though i like the slide cover of the oem charger which double a a carrying case i value be able to charge two battery at the same time this design be also much more compact than other sidebyside arrangement i ve see manufacturer information be rather scant so i m not sure what the actual power rating be none be print on the charger either but for 10 it be worth a shot,Good
i ve find that some of these new usb 30 flash drive be not much fast than their usb 20 counterpart even when connect to a usb 30 port that s not the case with the verbatim store n go v3 usb 30 testing use speedout 05 and check flash 116 show a insert in usb 20 port mb read write 25846 8114 b insert in usb 30 port mb read write 8547 10405 basically with small file read be more than 3x fast in usb 30 port than a usb 20 write do not show that big a difference only about 25 fast again keep in mind these test be use small file in short burst your result will vary if you be read andor copy gigabyte of file at a time tofor realom the flashdrive note that because of the way the slide mechanism be design if you want to attach this drive to a lanyard or keychain you need to use a cord rather than a ring a the attachment hole disappear into the body of the drive when fully engage see photo above,Good
i ve own this about a month and be seem to work fine with light use pro small 39 mm x 122 mm x 45 mm there be some flash drive that be a bit thin at about 25 mm but you loose the advantage of having protect contact tough all metal case it could survive a lot more abuse than compete flash drive that be plastic i have no concern with leave it on a keychain that get toss around large strong metal loop for keychain or lanyard inner diameter 84 mm decent speed but not blaze fast large file write 8mbs read 17mbs cost be very competitive compare to all other 16 gb drive and le than other in this small size class 5 year warranty con open end be susceptible to dust or lint accumulation it may need to be blow out periodically with compress air this be the tradeoff versus have a cap that may get lose do not fit into some machine the mechanical tolerance be such that it will not plug into some machine without use so much force that you risk damage the port on the computer i ve never experience this problem with any other usb drive i ve own and i have at least 10 different model include other for realom kingston there be not any excuse for this and it the reason i take off two star i can not use it in all universal serial bus port possibly with more insertionremoval cycle it will loosen up but it should work fine right out of the box bottom line if it fit the computer you need to use it with and high speed be not a concern it a great little flash drive at a good price but if you need a drive that must work in any random computer you encounter such a at the library this may not be the good choice,Average
these thing be pretty nice i like the pop when you connect they to the usb c port the only thing i do not like be the fact that female a port be completely open except for the blue plastic with the usb pin for connection this make for a lot of extra space for dirt and fuzz to collect i hope they release an update with the extra space close off i have even contemplate put an old nonworking flash drive in there and put some kind of liquid sealant in there to dry and harden this way there be more internal support a well i would not even be able to use one of those tiny flash drive with it that only have the small plastic piece and not a whole box connector,Good

after a very careful consideration of all available option i shortlist the follow router all within the same price range netgear nighthawk ac1900 amped athena ac2600 linksys wrt ac1900 linksys ac2600 they be all very powerful and it be difficult to make a final choice i be lean towards linksys wrt ac1900 just because of it awesome look check it out but i decide to go for a slightly more powerful linksys ac2600 since many of you will have a similar dilemma when choose a router i think it might be helpful if i share the rationale behind my decision linksys ac2600 have very good review in every source i look at it be either in top 3 5 or 10 list in every reputable tech website and even call the good router of 2017 on cheatsheet website it be one of the new router it be recommend for future technology it be offer at a good discount on amazon the other reason be of course mimumo technology the router be design for the speed 50mbps and up it can be use for 12 and more device at home we have a very heavy traffic a transmission rate for 5 ghz and parental control for any device that you choose now let get to the feedback after the actual purchase the setup actually take 5 minute it be very quick and straightforward of course you will need to choose a new wifi for every device in your home that will take a minute or le per device i could not believe my eye when i run the test on the speed see the photo the old router netgear give i a download speed of 25 mbps the new router with 24 ghz 4214 mbps and with 5 ghz 8960 mbps by the way it later go to 90 i do not even know that comcast have upgrade my 50mbps speed then i decide to test if it work at our neighbor house it automatically change to 24 ghz but i stoday i learnedl have 25mbps pretty good consider the distance before this router we have problem on the weekend the traffic be heavy and our old router could not cope with it not a problem anymore most modern device include roku 34 work with 5 ghz so you will enjoy a really nice and high speed of internet but even device that do not support 5 ghz eg playstation 34 have a very decent speed actually i can not even tell the difference when streamingplaye online i think i make the right decision i mean it be stoday i learnedl pricey compare to 90 router but if it continue to perform at these standard i do not mind pay a hefty price tag heck there be much more expensive router out there that i do not even consider i just select the one that seem to be reasonable for our need if you have any question i will be happy to answer they,Good

if you be like i i be look for another good flash drive and i use samsung ssds so this be a logical choice the main picture be a little misleading because they make the product appear the same size a a normal flash drive i like a beefy usb drive so i be a little surprised when i open the box this be in no way a negative mark against the product but i think it be worth mention because i fail to notice i can foresee other people order the product and expect a normal sized usb drive a well the product itself be fantastic i think i would be turn off by it small size but i ve grow to love it it a solid little flash drive with the quick speed you would expect for realom a quality usb 30 drive i would highly recommend,Good

very sharp at fullresolution a remark in the instruction and in other review use and focus be very easy but magnification depend on distance and the focus knob both so to get megacloseup you get the microscope itself close to the object and use the second focal length the one near to the side of the dial i ve be start at the wide zoomfocus which i think be roughly 50x max and snap an inithanks in advancel overview picture then zoom way in to get the detail i will say i be surprised i expect the capacitive touch button to be more effective it not that they implement it poorly it just that literally any motion at all wreck the image i may 3d print a sturdy stand a the flexibleneck be half the problem with that the solution so far have be to use the software button note also the video recording resolution in the include software be awful vga 640x480 limit whereas photo be up to 1600x1200 for 43 and 1280x720 for 169 to solve this i m use vlc for both playback and recording when video be desire the led be excellent and the diffuser be a welcome feature when examine solder joint i ve actually turn the led down a bit because it be too bright also of note this work with regular webcam chip and i have zero trouble instantaneous get this to work with cheese in linux on a raspberry pi which have no trouble at all handle the image and video good stuff my only complaint would be a fast interface capable of smoother previewrecording at high resolution you have to be patient it gag a little on anything over 10fps the attach image be of arduino nano pin tx led 1 mm on arduino nano rgb smd led and a closeup of one of the connect diode inside parallax light intensity sensor look like a grid wide and megaclose edge pin of an esp8266 chip on a nodemcu microcontroller closeup of the wifi logo on the same esp8266 chip sk6812 rgbww addressable led note the tiny ic and a gorgeous closeup of that ic and one of the diode httpswwwamazoncomdpb01k4htxocreftwisterb01m8hhaxiencodingutf8psc1,Good

instal this last weekend in a 2006 ponthanks in advancec g6 gt with monsoon without onstar install be easy but time consume here be a list of what i buy scosche automotive wire harness 1988up gm microdelco antenna adapter this be important because of the limited space on the back of the stereo esky high definition color wide view angle universal waterproof car rear view license plate backup camera with 7 infor realared night vision led imbaprice right angle gold rca adapter female to male 10 pack these be important because of the limited space on the back of the stereo mediabridge ultra series subwoofer cable 25 foot dual shield with gold plate rca to rca connector black bos audio kit10 4 gauge amplifier installation kit mediabridge 35 mm male to 2male rca adapter 6 foot step down design metra 953302 general motor ddin 2004 and up dash kit it important to get the right angle rca adapter and the antenna adapter there be very limited space behind the stereo after pull all the wire and disassemble the dash the rest of the installation be easy i have to run an extra wire form the fusebox in the center console to get the run12v signal to the stereo the swc wire be blue and green but i could not get they to work a meter show the change in resistance between the two when different button be press i run a few extra wire to they and tuck they under the carpet so i can work on they later without take the dash apart i be not sure if my car have factory wiring in it or not but i use my meter a lot to figure out what each wire do i also clip one wire at a time to see what turn off for my car the wire color be pink need 12v to turn on the monsoon amp hook this to your blue power antenna wire speaker wire do not remember off the top of my head ill look it up and post they later i just clip they one at a time to see which one turn off then use a meter to check the polarity red thick wire constant 12v connect to the yellow wire black thick wire ground or 12v green twisted with blue steering wheel control swc white wblk stripe dic orange dic green dic new wire for realom reverse light 12v signal for back up cam new wire for realom run fuse 2a 12v signal stereo to turn on pro bluetooth work well super cheap sound quality be acceptable love the wide range the sub volume have con it probably because i have a monsoon amp but i get a static sound when no music be play even when not charge my phone when use bluetooth or aux in the button be not very responsive it take a good couple of second to a react when change menu or use bluetooth track button album art and song info be not display when use pandora or other music stream software the volume be for the backup cam have it own setting it should have be a percentage of whatever the current volume level be not a set level this be annoying because if my bluetooth be be use the volume be usually set to about 13 but when radio be use the volume be set to 4 and my backup cam be set to 7 so when i shift into reverse and be play the radio the volume jump up way loud i end up just set it to 0 this probably will not be a problem if you do not have all your speaker hook to monsoon amp come to think of it i probably should have use the preamp output the wallpaper option kind of suck,Good
i ve have a drobo 20 for five year now and be mostly happy with it but eventually usb 20 become too slow for my need and firewire800 too unreliable on modern pc so i decide to upgrade to the 3rd generation i look at the drobo 5d but it be just too expensive for my need i also consider switch to a raid 5 setup instead but have always enjoy the upgrade flexibility and ease of use of my drobo 20 so i decide to stick with it and upgrade to the 3rd generation version of the same drobo i receive the drobo very quickly with amazon prime it come in a wellprotecte box and be wrap up inside a handy drobo tote bag it come with a usb30 cable and mi do not careord transformer power supply that be a little small than before physically the drobo itself look pretty much the same the light be a slightly different color and the for realont cover be a bit more seethrough which look nice there be now a power button on the back which be a very welcome addition and the firewire port be go inside the battery backup be also a very nice addition which will give the drobo time to shut down safely in the event of power loss the internal processor and memory cache have also be beef up which should help keep up performance over usb 30 after read some review on here i want to be sure my system be ready for my drobo before i try to set it up so i play around with my usb 30 driver a bit and decide the good way to go be with the generic window 81 microsoft driver uninstalle the age driver that come with my 4 year old gigabyte gap55aud3 motherboard i also check my bios setting and make sure everything be in order enable xhci disabled usb legacy etc once that be take care of i plug in both drobo and make sure each have the late firmware use drobo dashboard i then shut down my computer unplug both drobo transfer the disk and power the new drobo and my computer back on drobo dashboard tell i it be rebuild for 510minutes and then i be good to go easy a cake my drobo have about 6 tb use of 82 tb usable of 12 tb total lose 38 tb to redundancy and annoying 1024vs1000 hdd manufacturer marketing math i expect performance will change depend on how full the disk be my 2nd gen drobo always start to have speed problem when it have le than 15 for realee space and i expect that have not change much in any case i try copy some file to and for realom the drobo and my sataiii ssd to see how it do i get very consistent 125 mb read and 100 mb write off of the drive which be pretty good for my need i confirm these result use atto disk benchmark and see similar rate for file large than 512 kb see attach image the drobo dashboard also report it get about 200 iop under heavy load which be pretty good i m sure i could get more performance out of a raid 5 array but the ease of use of the drobo and the ability to add space at any time make that difference irrelevant to my need of course the other aspect of a hard drive array to consider be the redundancy the drobo can protect against the hardware failure of one disk in the array at a time and constantly keep track of disk health to hopefully warn you at least a little bit before it fail this feature always work well in my original drobo 20 i have a few disk fail over the year and the drobo take it in stride i expect the 3rd generation will be just a reliable but quick one thing to note be that this redundancy only protect against hardware disk failure and it be stoday i learnedl important to schedule chkdsk run for realom time to time to make sure the filesystem be stoday i learnedl intact it be also stoday i learnedl necessary to backup important file offsite because it be stoday i learnedl possible for other type of failure to occur i decide to test the reliability and rebuild speed of my new drobo by swap out one of the 3 tb hard drive for another blank 3 tb disk upon remove the drive the drobo start flash some angry light and warn you about the miss disk on the computer it then quickly reassure you your datum be safe and recommend you replace the miss disk to prevent further problem after instal the for realesh disk it be quickly detect and the array begin rebuild the dashboard estimate the process would take 18 hour which be great to see a my old drobo 20 sometimes take 2448 hour to rebuild i be also happy to find i be stoday i learnedl able to play 1080p video file off the drobo during the rebuild without problem another thing the drobo 20 struggle with during rebuild i leave it go overnight and be pleasantly surprised the next day to find the rebuild complete after only 12 hour have pas note that the rebuild will continue whether or not the drobo be plug into a computer but it should not be unplug for realom power while it do it thing after all that my drobo be work great again and have the same performance a prerebuilde hurrah in conclusion i be very happy with the drobo 30 it be price within consumer range again for the first time in a while and for that price be a definite upgrade for realom the drobo 20 it seem even more stable and fast all around and have the same industrial high quality build and design a before the few problem i have with the 20 have be rectify and i hope to get at least another five year out of this array before i decide to upgrade again pro super easy to use with intuitive informative software super easy to upgrade and expand storage much fast than drobo 20 with usb30 125110mbs high build quality and striking design protects against hdd failure and now have battery backup con stoday i learnedl not a fast a raid 5 sata array be a little touchy with usb 30 driver do not preventdetect filesystem failurecorruption,Good
get the product and be able to install it easily with a few thing to keep in mind do not plug it in immediately you need to install the driver first there be a cd provide however if you do not have a cd drive hey mac you can get the driver here httpwwwcablematterscomcsdownloadsaspx the second be even though it have you reboot after instal i do another shut down and turn back on and then connect the extra monitor otherwise it connect very easily be recognize a a third display second be via thunderbolt to hdmi and display the same qualityresolution a my second monitor which be good since they be identical my only complaint be that it be not plug and play but otherwise it a great little device,Good
this mic be fantastic i use it for stream youtube voiceover etc i be use a g230 headset for gaming which be fine but i want some high quality sound to give it all a more professional and warm bassy feel i be look to build a whole studio with the preamp or phantom power but simply could not afford it i have hear bad thing about usb mic or sound card so i be hesitant to grab this one i be not disappoint though it sound great there be no humming or hiss for realom the mic when it idle and if you plug your headphone into the back of it you hear both yourself and your system sound with 0 delay which be great for monitor your own quality because it have an xlr port a well a a usb port it a great choice if you re start out but plan to grow if i ever decide to grab a preamp or something i can easily upgrade it without have to buy a new mic i have this hook up to a neewer microphone desk mount which fit it just fine ill write a different review for that item a it not a great a i think but a far a compatibility it fit i would highly recommend grab a 35 windsock or foam cover for it to reduce your plosive and since it a dynamic mic it reduce the room sound greatly it only really capture noise directly in for realont of it,Good

it probably do the job a far a the surge protection but it only fit in a standard 2outlet plate it do not fit onto a power strip or work in any way other than in the standard 2outlet plate and it have to cover both outlet because of the extra plastic anchor which fit into the ground hole of the second outlet so basically you be trade 2 outlet for 3 plus a couple usb charge port might be fine for someone who need just that but it be not very versatoday i learnede,Average
i instal this unit into my 2001 explorer sport trac i instal it when i be add a new kenwood head unit it work well and the installation look very professional even though i only have to use two sheet metal screw to attach it i use this mount along with an amazon basic usblightne iphone cable to connect my iphone to my new radio it work well no communication or charge issue no need to buy that expensive oem cable i add a picture show how i instal this mount below my radio i attach it to my ashtraywho use an ashtray nowadays anyway,Good
i really like the case it fit my drago touch y88x tablet great i love this color too i do notice it can attract fingerprint stain but that it do not mean i will detract a star because it hold my tablet beautifully the keyboard work really well too and the fact that the seller reach out to i ask if i be fine with their product a purple stylus come with my case so that be really nice addition it be ship and deliver on time i will definitely be order a different color i will update my review if the keyboard on my case mess up,Good
do not work with my wd mybook i buy this to replace the short cable that come with the drive when connect it the drive light turn on but window never detect it switch back to the original cable and everything be fine what a waste of money update look carefully at the type a computer end connector the 5 extra pin use for usb 30 be mangle and bent look like it happen the first time i plug it in i assume they be not properly locate and get hook on something say alot about the quality control,Bad
i like this usb to ethernet adapter it appear to be of quality construction and error for realee function it a nice lowprofile design and work great with my surface the price point be attractive compare to microsoft or other big name they lack status lcd but one might note that the microsoft unit do too in truth i do not miss that feature and i be unwilling to pay more for it or bear the large size requirement i recommend this and other rankie adapter of which i now have quite a few,Good
when i get the package i be very underwhelmed when it appear in the package be already open i open the rest of the package be ready to use the plug and so far i be very impressed pro up to six device can be charge at one time there be a surge protector be and you can close some of the plugin con the device cover both plugin outlet and if you have a device plug in for over 24 hour a get a little hot to the touch,Good
i buy it for camping i happen to camp in a converted truck topper i use it all night power by a batter pack i pick up at walmart my other two fan be pretty good but eat d battery i will be buy another soon upgrade to 5 star it run on my goal zero solar panel the cord be long enough to keep the panel in the sun and the fan in the shade will buy another,Good
i instantly fall in love with this thing the moment i take it out of the package untoday i learned i get it i be use a sandisk cruzer titanium on my keychain and this be so much more convenient perfect,Good
buy these for a for realiend daughter birthday but my wife have take they then hiss at i they fit well even on an adult but could easily adjust for a child wire to a 35 mm jack and sound quality be pretty decent,Good
well it pink it come with fan and it ship amazon prime but that s where the positive end look like the for realont lcd temperature readout working be hit or miss and mine be a miss i m a computer technician and just set up the same thing in other case so i know this be not user error that s fine a this be for my daughter 8th birthday she will not be do anything that get the heat too high and do not want to wait for a replacement but if that s one of the thing you want in a case go with something else the transparent part of the side panel which be definitely red and not at all pink dip down right where the sata harddrive cable be this because the case side not to close correctly with l shape sata cable and a bit of finagle i could force it close but that s a serious design flaw note i try slide they in the opposite way and it would not work with mine but look at other picture it look like they do not use the exact same part for all these case perhaps over time they change which part they use my review stoday i learnedl apply for the case i receive i give it 3 star only because my daughter love it,Average
i love this thing i do not know about the readyboost thing for vista but the transfer rate be fast and 8 gb for the win,Good
a very nice set of good quality microusb cable that be much well than the cheapo cable the reversible end of the cable the large end be very convenient the braid cable be strong and thick which be nice but it do end up reduce the flexibility a little buy these if you want a good set of cable at a good price definitely worth the money over the cheap and subpar cable that use thin wire and be make very cheaply note i be send a for realee product sample for review i be not pay or tell what to write,Good
cable last i pretty much at least a year or two my wife and daughtersoh like 36 month top they be always on their iphones and ipads and keep it plug in while use so it get unnecessarily tug stretch bent etc seriously this mean that i buy at least 710 lightning cable per year these should last a while at least i m hope the braid cable should last long than the regular rubber one they be a little stiff but i do prefer that the lightning part be small so it will fit through the tiny opening on our case the only thing for i be that this color be a bit too sparkly for my taste then again i m the guy that always get the space gray iphone and ipad my wife and daughtersthey think it perfect i can live with that i receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review,Good
inithanks in advancelly i could not get this product to work i want to connect my iphone for charge and a canon lide 120 scanner power and datum the charge cord which be thin and have a loop of red heat shrink on it would not do anything at all i email the vendor get no response then i insert a usb data blocker portapow fast charge data block usb adaptor with smartcharge chip and it work see attach picture i have note for realom other commentsreview some device expect datum connectivity in order to charge for such device this vanilla y adapter will not work on the power side of the y i have personally find apple device to be particularly fussy about this my guess be that this y cable will only work for some combination of device however by introduce a usb smart data blocker on the power lead it could be an effective work around i give the y cable a 35 because it do not work for i without and addition component usb smart data blocker if it ship with such a device or otherwise have the device builtin i would give it a 55,Average
this fill my need for a usb 3 docking station that would drive 2 monitor with my computer image across 2 screen the dp support my 2560x1440 display through a startech 4port usb dp kvm switch and an hd display through a separate hdirect messagei kvm switch now i have up to 4 pc drive a dualmonitor setup everyone come into my office and ask how many computer i have this docking station be a level above most other especially in this price range it have all the port i need and lot of usb 3 not a bunch of usb 2 like you get with other i try a sexy usbc model for realom another source but my laptop port just be not up to the task and only 1 of my laptop even have usbc so it really be not a flexible a i need in a couple year i hope all pc use the same level of usbc but a of today most do not support datum video and especially power all together this usb 3 model work with all my laptop and i m not really miss out on bandwidth i just have to plug my laptop into the usb 3 dock and a power source then i m up and run last bit of general advice if you re like i and you buy lot of stuff on amazon especially electronics then you must use fakespot to root out all of the fake review that some of the seller use 4 or 5 star just do not mean the same thing if it come for realom fake reviewer,Good
i be one of those customer who keep try different bluetooth adapter for car audio system and have not find the good one yet i have already test more than 10 bluetooth adapter before so this review be a critical comparison with other adapter that i already own some key benefit that it offer and some suggestion it work fine when pair with smartphone with car audio system via aux jack sound quality be good for the price it work a describe pairing be a simple a other bluetooth adapter auto power on with ignition and pair to last connected device automatically center button act a multifunction button to makereceive call and two side button control music playback i use my own car charger while test it io notification screen be show 100 battery level which be kind of funny a it do not come with build in battery con my big complaint be it lack of aac support which it claim to support in my test i find that it do not support aac codec and notify seller about the issue aac in bt receiver may not be a big deal for first time buyer but it be for those who have experience difference in audio quality aac provide high fidelity audio over bluetooth connection similar to aptx overall audio level be very low i have to crank up my speaker 50 high to get the same audio level overall a good bt receiver for car owner without bluetooth connectivity and for a generic bt receiver the price be just about right 1099 a of 05072016 i be provide a sample for for realee to test and review and be ask only to give my honest review let i know if you have any question about the product,Good
yet another great product for realom iclever this be a great charging station i work in it so it sit on my desk i use it to charge company ipads before deployment or when i need to service one and the user bring it to i dead i also charge other mobile device that do not have usb charging since there be 2 handy regular power outlet available the regular outlet be nicely space allow for power brick to be use not just small cube or regular plug also since it have 5 fully powered usb port pump out 24a it ll charge your small device quickly it even have a handy little channel in the center that you could set a device while it charge i do wish the channel in the center be either a little large or have a bit more of a reverse slant when put my iphone 6 in there it tend to lean forward rather than back so it not convenient for desktop or landscape viewing of the device that would be my only complaint but it be not a deal breaker,Good
use this to turn a regular 35 mm headset into a usb headset on my ps4 yes i can just plug into the controller with the 35 mm plug however i m play street fighter v with a fightstick i prefer to use the brook ps3 to ps4 super converter to plug straight into the ps4 instead of use the legacy controller option in the game with the converter i do not need to have a ps4 controller on to use the fightstick however the downside of use the converter be i can not use my headset with this sound adapter that fix that problem yes now there s a lot of wire come for realom ps4 but now i do not need the ps4 controller to navigate with the ps4 menu something the legacy controller option do not let you do a for the actual sound it work a advertise no hiss audio cut inout and mic audio seem to be just fine a well,Good
first off i read several complaint about the width of the drive if you use a sandisk cruzer 20 mm you can use the sandisk extreme 21 mm it be substanthanks in advancelly long 14 mm than the cruzer however see customer image for a comparison i only have usb 20 port in this laptop i format the drive under window 7 in ntfs format with the default allocation size for a speed test i copy 6 video file total 128 gb the transfer speed be steady at 25 mb which should have result in a 9 minute transfer the total transfer time be roughly 115 minute i notice that the transfer halt for about 30 second each time a file be finish copy a window prepare to copy the next file there be also significant lag time at the completion of the transfer this may be because of the formatting because of window because i only have 4 gb of ram 25 of which be occupy and or because i be run usb 20 i do another transfer test in which 190 file 288 mb be transfer in 9 second all thing consider this drive be blaze fast in usb 20 compare to my sandisk cruzer drive which average about 43 mb i also have no complaint about the sturdiness of the drive or the slide mechanism i order it in standard packaging rather than for realustrationfor realee packaging i m begin to think that for realustrationfor realee packaging be another way of say cheap knockoff refurbish item at full price,Good
maybe i get a lemon but a you can see for realom my crystaldisk bench mark the samsung usb flash drive be incredibly slow a compare to the cheap sandisk fit and the kingston microduo all about same physical size 32 gb and usb 30 a well could not even break 38mbs read for large file the sandisk perform at 119mbs and the kingston at 129mbs skip the more expensive samsung and go with something fast and cheap instead ill consider return mine,Bad
for presentation i periodically need to have a document camera i be even plan on concoct a stand to hold a microsoft webcam untoday i learned i come across this beauty it have very high resolution see the 3 picture i post on amazon page to get a well idea focus to within 2 of target a serviceable software interface be easily portable and have a very favorable price point especially when compare to other document camera and i speak for realom experience having use very pricey elmos on occasion the only criticism i have be that it do not have build in light a bit surprising since many webcam now have dimmable led lighting integrate in the software provide more control option than most with my favorite feature be set once focus there be also a button on the camera to trigger this which eliminate the problem of focus reset at slight provocation my o be window 7 and installation be trivial software be supply on cd or if like i you do not have an optical drive it can be download for realom the p2v website one more thing that might be of interest i often need to project the image of a device with a color touch screen something camera often have trouble with this one have ample setting for make that work especially when you place it in close think iphone for my travel i ponie up for the manufacturer travel case about 20 well worth the add cost it take good stoday i learnedl but if you want movie you will need third party software something i prefer since i have an arsenal of camera for various purpose,Good
only buy this brand because other model of the same generic hub be silver i need black it work very well however when reboot the pc if there be a mix of usb 3 and usb 2 device the usb 2 device will stop work untoday i learned the hub be power cycle really cool how the charge port only light up if it detect that you re use a charge cable v a datacharge cable i ve adjust my review after change pc to a well usb chipset all issue have be resolve in regard to need to power cycling i have be use this device since november 2015 it have be power on 247 during that time and i have have zero issue all around great product,Good
the usb connector seem to be high quality and fit just fine the wire itself be nice and thick the enclosure be strong and not brittle plastic material the nut be 14 thick plastic which be not brittle have two grip so it be easy to install the rubber cover fit well and seal the mount to your panel it be clearly splash proof i be pleasantly surprised to find that the thread portion be 1 long so the port can be instal in 34 material without any adapter one installation tip i d like to pas on although you could simply drill a 34 inch hole in your panel it much well to dupicate the two flat on the screw so the housing do not turn in your panel i think the reviewer who leave negative review about the mount must have simly drill a round hole,Good
i have attach a ton of picture the case be an atx case so it a bit more on the large size it have ton of space come with 3 fan 1 black rear face 2 clear for realont face the inside of the case be clean i definitely like the layout and that i can add 4 hard drive a solid state and stoday i learnedl have 2 additional 525 space above that stoday i learnedl do not take all the space while i m not sure if everyone would like this the power and reset button be pretty small on the for realont of the case i like this because my current case a the button and it easy to reset just by bump into the button which happen way more than it should so i like these be a little out of the way but not inconvenient,Good
i have not be much of a fan of lexar product in the past but need something a bit fast and inexpensive since my 32 gb sandisk could not keep up with 4k video recording on my lumia 1520 so far so good have not have any problem at max setting and have also notice app and music seem to respond much quick a well sd card speed interface speed test with sandisk micro sdhc 32 gb 636 mb and lexar be 309 mb use the usb 30 adapter that come with the card and be able to copy my video recording at 90 mb to my pc which be run ssd drive be go to try the 128 gb version but be not willing to risk it at the time will have to try the 128 gb version next note that test be interface speed of the lumia 1520 use the card mention above this card may be fast or slow base on other phone or device for all you lumia 1520 fan out there this one work,Good

i have be use the caldigit usbc dock for about two week with great success i select this dock over several other candidate because it have a displayport output most usbc dock only have an hdirect messagei output this dock have be use with a 2016 apple 12 retina macbook a 27 2560x1440 display connect via displayport and wire gigabit ethernet pro displayport and hdirect messagei monitor output usb 3 port on the for realont for connect flash drive or other temporary use accessory gigabit ethernet usb typec port on the back for future usbc accessory separate headphonemicrophone jack on the for realont support usbc power delivery so it will charge your macbook might charge the new macbook pro slowly however caldigit offer a for realee mac utoday i learnedity for eject all usbconnecte drive at once make it easy to disconnect your macbook at the end of the day warm to the touch but do not get hot like other docksusbc adapter con only three usba jack one on for realont two on back more four or five would be nice that say i have an old usb 20 hub connect to one of they and the connection have be rocksolid and stable use a cypress semiconductor usb 30gigabit ethernet chipset which require installation of an additional driver other usbethernet adaptor chip for realom realtek work with device class driver and do not require additional software builtin ethernet do not always make a connection when the dock be plug in just act like the ethernet cable be disconnect even though it connect this can be cure by disconnect and reconnecte the dock uncertain if it a dock issue or a macos issue a i have have this problem with other usbethernet adapter on other mac laptop ethernet connection be stable and fast once in place other note macos do not support displayport multistream transport so for we mac user we effectively can only use one external display yes i know the same signal get send to both the hdirect messagei and displayport output window do support mst so you can extend the desktop onto both connect monitor newer apple macbook pro have high charge current requirement than the 12 retina macbook so this dock may charge they more slowly than you d like use a thunderbolt 3 cable not a typical usbc to usbc cable your apple charging cable for example will not connect this dock to your macbook,Good
purchase this device in early november of 2016 and use it very routinely since then never abuse by any mean but i do use it for realequently a i set it up a a ghost boot drive and use it to create workstation image for my work then in late april of 2017 i decide to clean off my important file ie irreplaceable picture of my daughter and family and move they to a secure storage good thing i do because about a week later it die to a nonrecoverable state all attempt to format or low level partition fail a see in the picture the drive now show up a 64 mb rather than 128 gb i do fill out a sandisk rma so well see how that go at the end of the day the rating be base on the horrible lifespan of the drive i ve get 20 old drive of various size for realom year ago stoday i learnedl work like champ so it disappointing that the new one would fail like this i shudder to think if i d lose all the pic but then again a an it guy i m always go to have a nagging worry that i do not get all of they off anyways when it do work the drive would always run a bit hot plug into the main usb port do not really heat up when use the micro usb to connect a an otg the otg be pretty nice a it help i load rom onoff my phone edit i add a star because the sandisk team be very good about the rma process they be quick and provide great communication throughout normally i might consider bump another star but in this case i just can not because with flash medium there s basically no recover datum on a fail device and that be very concern to i a far a the product quality go,Average
these work very well at usb cable the cable even support fast charging on my galaxy s7 edge i know there be a review here that say that the cable do not please check the photo in this review the cable be flexible and durable not really much to say about usb cable they work and work well definitely worth the money,Good

great product compare well to other lead brand like mediabridge the tangle for realee be accurate for the most part though it will make this cable hard to fit in more compact area such a tight laptop bag or other backpack because of the wire stiffness other than that have not have any issue with the connector it be small than the mediabridge one that i have so if your device micro usb port be in a hard to reach area this cable may be a well fit for you see picture include,Good
positive both end of the cable be reversible work just like any other micro usb cable i do not have any issue with charge or datum transfer really convenient if you do not have a usb type c device but want a reversible cable negative the full size usb end do not always go in smoothly and sometimes take a bit of fiddle to plug in the micro usb end really click into port like almost too firmly not sure if this be bad or not for the port in the long run other note the length of the cable be just average at 33 foot it neither long nor too short just average i do wish the cable be a braid cable instead but this standard cable be okay i receive this product in exchange for a review but this do not affect my opinion,Good
the case be purchase for my daughter who want a pink case the color aside not my personal choice the quality of the case be excellent for the price range there be well case out there but they cost more too the gauge on the for realont work a advertise the fan controller be a nice feature you can daisychain all the case fan together and control all of they for realom 1 central spot to control the noise v cool issue of all case fan the case include more fan than most include the giant side fan which have red lead lighting i m not personally a fan of have to open the for realont panel to access the optical drive etc but it do not seem to bother my daughter my 2 criticism be 1 no handle on the top of the case to carry it around and 2 the foot on the bottom be too short to allow good airflow for realom any bottom mount fan which will include at least the psu fan however these 2 criticism of mine be true for the vast majority of pc case out there and i almost always mod my pc case for tall bottom foot and carry handle by the way if you want to mod the case a mention it can be easily accomplish see attach modded photo please note that the tall foot and the carrying handle be case mod not include for realom the manufacturer,Good

like most people who buy this i just upgrade to the google pixel 2 xl and have be trudge through the process of upgrade all my usb cable and such type c be great ultra fast charging and no single direction woe but the lack of a dedicated 35 mm jack be annoying to say the least sure google throw a dongle in the box to give you a virtual jack but it be ugly and cumbersome plus if you lose it you re sol luckily this cable exist i have a pair of status audio cb1 headphone and one of the good feature of it be the ability to swap out the cable this product fit flawlessly and totally eliminate the need for that awful white dongle in the mix audio quality be pretty great definitely only able to output cd quality 16bit441khz test use poweramp high quality audio seem to sound well but it might just be a placebo effect or good downsampling a a sidebyside comparison i play some high resolution audio file for realom album i know well i use the provide dongle for realom google use the cable that come with the headphone and then this cable the amp build in to this be definitely a bit louder exact db level be beyond what i can measure accurately though it qualitatively sound like about a 15 increase but perceive quality be pretty much equal enough so that i could not notice a difference i remember read a review that mention use this cable with the same headphone and the reviewer notice a lot of background noise they definitely get a bad cable because i do not get that at all audio be clean and enjoyable also work plug the usb end in either direction with zero difference in performance overall i m extremely happy with this product and be really happy it exist packaging be great build quality be very good and it seem like it will last a long time my only beef be that it do not output high resolution audio which 90 of people will not notice or care about a the only available solution to my problem ill be very happy use this but if a company want to really put out something great there would be an audiophile version p if you encounter any problem with this it be most likely you just get a bad unit exchange it and try again it happen this cable work perfectly if you get a properly qad unit some fall under the radar or get damage in shipping do not just shame something if you get a bad unit,Good
complete crap two be already dead when they arrive of the four operating system in use in my house none could even tell one of these drive be plug in even after try both of they on every port on every machine with and without any of three usb 20 or 30 hub plug in handing one to a for realiend with a mac do not show that they work with that fifth operating system either even though i go week at a time without plug these in because i rarely need to copy file onto a flash drive two more crap out within three month same problem the light flash to indicate data readswrite but no operating system on which they re try can tell that there s even a drive plug in need to use the last one last night and be hope it be stoday i learnedl work since it work fine last time i use it about two month ago and it be sit in a padded protective case since then with it plastic cap cover the usb port nope it too have silently die while be store safely under safe condition even during the brief time these drive be work they be incredibly slow read other customer review and see what turn out to be the lie crap response for realom the company convince i that maybe the speed problem be with the underlie fatbase file system so i reformatte some of the work one to test that theory nope they be equally slow with ntfs ext2 ext4 xfs jfs and reiserfs a the underlying file system they re just really really slow device copy datum read rate datum write rate on any reasonable actual use not only do not meet the advertised speed they be never even close in fact try they on an old dell laptop that s a decade and a half old and with only a usb 11 port show that their read and write speed never even hit the point where the usb 11 connection be the bottleneck so they may have a usb 20 port on they but that s just put lipstick on a pig the underlie hardware be not fast enough for that to matter and for the record this be not a problem with other application hog the processor or memory or other system resource while the test be be perform these test be perform for realom a textbase terminal on two separate drive the only two stoday i learnedl operate after two month of own the fivepack and barely use it that be the only usb device plug into a for realesh new bare install of ubuntu server which have not even have a graphical layer instal on it also test at the same time on another usb 20 flash drive plug into the same computer show that it be much fast i guess i m not surprised by this if you dig in a bit you can see that unlike flash drive for realom reputable manufacturer which take care to identify themselves by brand name to the operating system and you can see this in the driveselection menu of some application my first ever flash drive for instance for realequently appear in drive selection list a lexar jumpdrive this particular set of drive identify itself to the host operating system simply a productcode which suggest to i that they re just remarkete crap hardware for realom elsewhere i buy five usb drive for twenty buck and manage to use the five of they on maybe twenty separate occasion total before they all die when they work they be incredibly slow so if you ve get twenty buck these flash drive be a great pretext for throw it away or you could send it to i i m a broke grad student who will not pretend to be give you anything other than the satisfaction of send twenty buck to someone who need it,Bad

not even know that they exist so please allow i to explain this product to you this device have a total of 10 amp of current to charge up to 6 device and that can be divide between it 6 usb port to charge any device that charge for realom usb that you own but how it work be not by simple division because it use tech to be smart about it because not all device charge use the same amount of current this charger will automatically adjust each usb port to the need of the device that you plug into it whether it your bluetooth headphone your phone or tablet you ll just plug in and the port will adjust for it simple i test this with about 12 of my own product include apple and android speaker and headphone and then i bring it to work and instruct my employee to use it this all take about a month and then i put the meter to it to test it electronically i m include an image to show you just one of the test that i perfome i use a device that will draw the current out of it at 21 amp with my port a pow usb tester in between you can plainly see that this be over 21 and at 226 amp at 504 volt and that s over it rating and not a bad charge at all for your 24 amp tablet then just for fun and because i can i connect another load that will draw up to 3 amp of current to another port at the same time to see how high i could get it up to with the go mass meter connect i bring it up to 269 amp and check the voltage and again it be just over 5 volt and no voltage drop be good now do not worry that it too high this be just what it capable of and your tablet electronic will ask for the amount of current that it need for charge the battery and then the charger will provide what s available for it for realom it total so if it want every bit of 24 amp like they sometimes will it there and more so this charger have test just above perfect if that s possible now 10 amp split up into 6 port equally be only 167 amp but here what might happen you might have two 24 amp tablet plug in and then let see what happen with the remain available current with two 24 amp tablet plug in you ll have 13 amp remain for each of the four open port and that will stoday i learnedl charge four 1 amp phone at full speed or most any other device that you might need charge some phone will draw up to 2 amp and with just one like that charge with two tablet it would total 68 amp use leave 32 amp for the remain 3 port and again will be okay for 1 amp charging for realom they so you ll need to know your device current requirement but just remember when do these calculation that the charging be smart on all the remain port now i hope that you understand the whole idea behind calculate for the device that you have and how much current that you ll need 10 amp in any room be quite a bit and often i have le but i have they all over and sometimes two in one room you do need a space to set all these 6 device while they re charge after all what happen when you plug in too much the device will just charge more slowly that s all no spark or smoke just proportionally slow charging for what s plug in while this be at work there be never an issue with the 10 amp that this provide and that be among seven audio techie while we could have fill it with our 24 amp device because we all have they it never have more than three plug in at any one time because they all have to actually need to be charge at the same time and they never do so this charger will satisfy almost anyone shop for one but i do need to point out that you ll find 12 amp 60 watt 6 port model also and if you will be charge three 24 amp tablet regularly that might be a well choice you can shop for the price difference and make your own decision about that this be a very nice charger that s also a small a can be for travel with the 40 inch power cable be detachable and can be wind up for storage with it include velcro cable tie and this will all pack into the carry bag that you ll receive too this be a really nice design for quick packing and storage the charger itself have world wide protection circuitry for the ac and it 5 volt usb output to protect all your device for realom over charge too this company be make a very nice product that you ll find to be use high quality electronic and that they be not overrate their specification they ll actually out perform they instead so my recommendation be that if you want the fast charging and have calculate your device current requirement and like i do not need 12 amp this be really a nice model that i recommend 24 month warranty 247 email customer support supportimutonet there you go i hope that all your online purchase be good one,Good
this review be for imbaprice usbmfan usb mini desktop fan i read several good and negative review with the conclusion of the noise level and quality i decide to roll the dice and get it a for the value you could not beat it i also do not want a battery operate or ac my main criterion set be to be quiet enough for office use usb so it can plus into the docking station and blow enough air i be very happy with the purchase a it be quiet compare to many other desk fan i have hear the usb be ideal to power it via computer wall charger or even portable battery pack the amount of air it blow be just the right amount if it be too much it ll dry your eye all day which be extremely annoying if it be too little it pointless and this mini usb desk can be just right it blow a nice consistent air i m very pleased with this purchase if you have find my photo and review to be helpful please click on helpful i be an avid amazon shopper and depend on the review of other to help make my purchase i would only return the same favor back to the community and pride myself on be a honest in my review a possible i hope this be helpful,Good

receive the package and it be mess up i believe this be an amazon issue and i alert they via feedback but the envelope that it be package in be tear open and the box that contain the cable be smash in on one side one of the cord be bent in the process where it connect to the phone and it do not seem usable a for the cord that do work it seem tight in the micro usb port which be really great and it seem to work well with the rapid charge a it be charge up the phone a fast or well than the oem cable normally i would give anker a 5star rating but i be give this two star base on the fact that one of the two card i receive be damage and unusable,Bad
pro easy to install the led light look nice and fast con raid be a pain to setup a three different operating system would not register my raid0 setup the sata point on the motherboard can be in the way of most sli configuration it just a design flaw most motherboard have i prefer the sata port to be on the very bottom if at all possible,Good
i want to look for a respectable stereo microscope for view and digitally archive my grow coin collection but be not sure i be ready to invest the money into a professional device for the price of the ebotrade 5mp usb microscope you do get a functional product with some limitation the key to this microscope depend on what object you ll be try to view the figure to understand be the magnification the minimum magnification state be 20x power which may not seem like much but be actually quite a large value follow the include setup leaflet to the letter and after software calibration the low magnification i could reach be 25x power hmm this be not a good thing unless you re try to observe very small object generally object not visible to the naked eye then this could be a problem for a typical coin which be say the size of a u quarter this be way too high of a magnification the problem be the include metal rod which the focus mount attache to be way too short the focus mount have a rod range of about 5 inch and the focus mount can adjust another 12 inch for realom there however because the camera can only mount in one position that you can proper access the camera focus wheel the low magnification i can reach be 25x power i ve modify my stand to 11 by extend that metal rod by 6 use a plastic spool rod for realom a dvd spindle it actually work quite well and by add just small amount of electrical tape the spindle rod stay tightly in place at the base i can get my needed magnification now which after calibration work about to be 16x power for my test coin which be 31 in diameter for a large coin i will obviously need to reduce power which should not be a problem now note i do not have to modify the product at all i just add a piece to it to raise the include base support here my overall assessment of the product pro 1 camera have good resolution for price point 2 overall kit work well for certain hobby some well than other 3 software for pc and mac 4 usbpowered led camera with adjustable zoom 5 stable base platform 6 led light system work well con 1 box claim manual be include which be false it on the include cd and only a tiny setup leaflet be actually include in the box 2 software be pretty limited and have zero help include read the manual for calibration instruction 3 software work ok on the macbook air and window 7 but the application crash for realom time to time on window 4 software do not store any default setting so user must set the resolution set and recalibrate upon every launch of the software 5 the camera focus wheel can be a little stiff to turn at time without throw off center especially a high magnification 6 advertised minimum zoom be mislead it close to 25x power user must increase camera distance to reduce magnification would be nice to do this thru the software but you can not my final rating would be close to 355 star but i can not quite bump to 4 star due to the con list hopefully the software issue can be address in a future update if anyone can find a metal pole with the exact same dimension a the include version but at a 12 length then please leave a comment,Average
i use these to deliver photograph to my customer they look so clean and slick with the rest of my packaging i wish they have they in gold and all of the flash drive work a well ill be use these for a long time,Good
the only reason i be give this one star be that it be really awkward and uncomfortable to use with a microsoft surface pro 4 the cable between the usbdp be too short probably work fine with other product just not mine sadly the siig mini dp usb lan hub will not lay flat when i hook in an ethernet or hdirect messagei thing start to roll off the desk notice in the picture that it be lopside also impossible to use with just a computer and my lap otherwise the product do behave a advertised hdirect messagei output no problem ethernet inout no problem usb3 hub no problem i do not use the dp port but because it be so awkward to use with my application i have to send it back,Bad

i ve be carry this flash drive with my key for month now it do it job and i have not have any problem with it my only complaint be that it have a hole for a key ring but the hole be so small that a standard sized ring just do not fit luckily i have a small one sit around so if you plan on carry this with your key make sure you also order small ring i measure the diameter of the key ring i use it look like it about 132nd of an inch or 03125 or maybe you can file out the hole a little bit and fit the standard 116th inch ring i include a picture next to a quarter for size reference one more thing if the cap come off just glue it back on duh,Good
fantastic and i m so impressed with this charger i have have my lax lightning cable for about 2 week and could not be happy with it a soon a i take it out of the package visually and by the feel of it i could tell i have make the right decision buy it for example it have charge my phone 10 in le than 10 minute after several purchase i have make on amazon of different charge i finally know i do not need to waste any more time you will not be disappoint,Good
i be pleasantly surprised by this handy little device all you need to do be plug it into your cigarette light plug and it automatically power on and can accept bluetooth connection the button right in the for realont be super convenient and allow you to quickly and easily navigate through music adjust volume etc button along the top for realont easily change the transmit for realequency so you can use whatever fm channel you desire once you set your radio to the same channel you be transmit you be ready to go just connect your phone via bluetooth and you audio will pipe through your car speaker you can also you the auxiliary input or other medium to play to the speaker a quick funny story when i first power it on after tune my radio to the same for realequency a smooth voice come on over the speaker that i swear say wait for perry who s perry i do not know but i be pretty sure it really say wait for pairing after you connect another voice say that you have pair and your good to go i be quickly able to start stream music for realom my phone for realo my amazon account to this device and then to the car speaker the sound be very good i be surprised i even make a couple call to test the ability to call use the device and it work well i be pretty happy be able to use the button on the device to switch song for realom my amazon playlist the device remember previously bluetooth connection and automatically will reconnect to your phonedevice when you for example restart your car after stop to get gas and a bag of chip for anyone without the ability to connect to your car stereo over bluetooth seriously consider get this it work great now for a small amount of criticism i do think the design of the neck be a little too stiff and the angle be awkward i have to rotate the plug around and twist the main interface around to get it in the right direction for my vehicle which do not seem like it be mean to do that or perhaps maybe just because it be so new the other thing be that it do stick out quite a bit for realom the plug i have an automatic so it do not interfere with drive operation those that have a manual may find the head piece get in the way when shift in first gear depend on the layout of your vehicle over all this thing be great and i be very happy to use it i do have a bluetooth receiver in my deck in my car but this extra device allow i to have multiple phone connect at the same time and switching between they be a simple a change my source on my deck for realom bluetooth to fm thus whether or not you already have a bluetooth capable deck stoday i learnedl consider this guy disclaimer i have receive this product for for realee i would stoday i learnedl buy it nonetheless,Good

this be for the 25 model 257e7qdsb i purchase it expect it to be vesa mountable and yes it be good but upon confirm this i soon find out that it be entirely unclear how to remove the neck for the stand which come affix to the display the include quick start guide say nothing about remove it so i go to the interweb and be relieve to quickly find the full manual pdf just search philip 257e7qdsb 25inch manual the full manual must say something about it right i mean those vesa hole could not have get there by accident right yet not a word in the entire manual about how to remove the neck maybe it obvious how to do remove it i mean i sometimes consider myself a diyer i get off to a good start use my rapid screw detection ability to identify and remove two philip screw on the plastic cover over the input not know what would happen next i push pull twisted etc and could not get the cover to budge i figure i need to pry but be not about to stick thing inside the new monitor without know what be under there fortunately at least one other reviewer before i encounter the same for realustration a i their description assure i that there be no selfdestruct button hiding under that plastic cover so i go back in and after a nontrivial amount of prying it take get under the edge on all four side i be able to slide that panel off reveal 4 mount screw hold the neck in place these screw each with a washer will also fit the vesa hole see uploaded photo for some further illustration of what this nonsense look like maybe they ll make thing a little easy for you now that i ve get it mount and connect to my mid2015 macbook pro run sierra it be the perfect companion to my 27 primary display picture be definitely satisfactory so far it work well picture look good though need more info and time to really say but for the price i m definitely happy however i can not in good faith give this 5 star because someone somewhere miss the human factor on this big time result in a glaring and honestly perplex omission across literally all of their documentation of how to remove that neck,Good
this 5port 8 ac outlet coocheer power strip surge protector do not have a ul label on the device i m not an electrical engineer so i rely on certification such a etl ieee or ul approval if i see the ul seal i know that a surge protector meet the minimum 1449 standard i could find no safety information on this product the only seal that i could locate be rohs restriction of hazardous substance and fcc which be a communication seal find on wireless device i go to the manufacturer website look for more information but at the time i look the site have very little if any detail about any of it charge product i have attach picture of the only information provide by the manufacturer of this surge protector this surge protector have no indicator light to let one know if the protection component be function i do not even know what those component might be or if there be an internal circuit breaker to trip the device if there be a short or an overload because it to overheat the power cord be just over 4 foot long and much thin than the heavy duty cord that i have on every other of my power strip the surge energy level be list a 1700 joule that may be adequate and i may use that level for lamp clock etc but not for my expensive and power hungry electronic there be no way for i to test the 1 nanosecond response to surge level but i do have to question why the blue lead usb charge light remain light for half a minute after the power switch be turn off while i do have a full house surge suppressor i be very conscientious a well a cautious about also use surge suppressor strip power strip be on the list of top because of home fire i would use this coocheer charging station a a temporary way to charge my usb device and the outlet for a lamp or other small appliance however without some indication of it meet minimum acceptable safety standard i would not feel comfortable leave it unattended when in use disclosure a complimentary product be send to i for trial and evaluation i have no connection to the seller or the manufacturer and my review be base solely on my perception of the merit of the product,Average
i recently buy this and another makemodel usb fan for my new cubicle job after use both extensively i have some note a to this particular unit function though i do want to say since i have a compare and contrast of similar item at the same price range i do prefer my other fan a tad more so this mini fan include a standard 18650 battery use in many other usb item such a tactical flashlight we happen to have several other of these battery on hand if you do not you can invest in a 2 pack for around 11 on amazon at the time of this review i note this because i feel have multiple battery extend the convenience of keep this cord for realee and on the go while you can leave it hook up to usb and use it endlessly the power be a bit weaken when run solely off direct power in charge mode here be the time i calculate on a full battery for each speed low 7 hour 40 minute medium 4 hour 3 minute high 1 hour 50 minute charge time seem to be about 4 hour though i be able to knock the speed to 35 hour with one of my well cable not the cable provide you can also run this off of a power bank a i also do in my cubicle since we can not use the power outlet for personal accessory the blue light which be optional be nice but really have no purpose for i it look cool and it do not seem to drain the battery noticeably quick the button be very stiff to use in my opinion and the design be not a modernchic a i would like lastly i think this really could use some sort of kickstand to angle it a i often have to prop it against something because it almost never on a surface flush with my face i do receive a discount in hope i would share my honest thought which i have do,Good
buy this for my wii you i do not need a large hard drive since the wii you game be not that big at all i think donkey kong tropical for realeeze be around 10 gig i think it would be a waste to put a 500 gig or even 1 terabyte external drive on the wii you and i do not want to spend 50 or 100 for a 500 or 1 tb external hd respectively this external hard drive work perfectly and hold all the game for realom the nintendo eshop and all my game save datum along with the dlc for mario kart 8 and super smash bros this be a great purchase for the wii you also this hard drive be format in ntfs it do not matter what it be format a because the wii you will format it to what it use so if you buy the exfat format drive it will work also,Good
i try several time to get this resolve with the supplier with no luck the power supply cable connector have a key way the mating connector on the supply do not so they do not fit together i send they picture they be attach they claim it be design that way to prevent connect the wrong way they do not get it i try multiple time it will not connect properly to anything it be possible to force the part together but since the housing get distort the pin get bent or push in much of the time it will not last long,Bad

this 4 port hub supply a total of 900 ma their 7 port and 9 port hub provide 900 ma per port the consequence be that it will not support portable external drive for example i have a 1 tb wd external drive all power be supply by usb that do not work with this hub i have this amazonbasics 4 port usb 30 hub with 5v25a power adapter i do not know what be the current rating but all my device include the external hard drive work fine with it kingwin hub work fine with my camera and open up the file folder in window this hub be fine for most of the light device but that be not enough for i other negative 1 manual a long paper sheet be not update even though the hub be a permanently connect cable manual stoday i learnedl show and describe usb type a and type b removal cable 2 port be on top of the strip amazonbasics hub have the port on the side and more convenient and look tidy 3 when i first connect the hub to my computer the blue light light up but none of the connect device be recognize on the computer after disconnect and reconnecte everything be ok would not recommend to for realiend or family,Bad
i originally get this fan to help cool off an internal hard drive i be use externally with an adapter but soon i find some way well use for it i find this device also help cool off hot flash drive that get hot while in use on a computer photo attached really help cool down electronics this fan also help cool i down on a hot summer day in my house without i have to put a full sized desk fan on my already crowded computer desk this fan produce quite a breeze it be not a strong a a full size fan but do produce quite some airflow without make much noise i use arctic cooling fan in my computer so i know they be very good at produce a lot of airflow without make much noise this fan do the same thing the fan have to be point directly at you or the object you be cool off though the fan provide very good directional airflow but do not move much air around it i find it easy to use with a small portable battery bank when i m in bed or somewhere away for realom my computer and it be easy to use with a usb dock photo attached a mention early in the review i do not have room on my desk for a full sized fan so this compact size come in handy not to mention it do not draw much power so it be energy efficient i feel downside to the fan be that it could have have a long goose neck i feel it be a bit short and be not a flexible a i want it to be so 1 star off other than that i ve have a good experience with it also arctic could have put some protection around the fan blade it do hurt a bit if the fan blade hit your hand when it be spin at full speed it be not strong enough to cut you or seriously hurt you but it be slight hazard you have to be kind of careful when use this fan update 6112016 2 month later it seem the fan blade have become slight unbalanced i think the fan assembly have a slight wobble to it really slight but it now make a really faint click click click sound when it be on and i can see a slight wobble i can not really hear it unless i try to listen for it and it do not bother i but i be take 1 star off a it seem this fan be not a good a i think it be i will update if the fan get bad,Average
i ve not pay much attention to acer in the past 2 decade remember they only for realom the 90 a second rate ibm clone machine i have not look at any of their computer since i do not expect much for realom this computer however i be blow away by this laptoptablettabtop laplet flextop i think i like flextop the first thing i notice right out of the box be the quality of construction fit and finish be superb and the computer feel really solid and well make have an ssd solid state drive silicon memorybased boot drive it boot very fast even if it be saddle with the mediocre window 10 operating system anyone familiar with my review know i be no fan of window microsoft or bill gate i consider they evil the screen be breathtake although the glossy finish do have the expect reflection problem i will happily trade that for the sharp clear image for realom a glossy screen it have one usb 20 port two usb 30 port and one usbc port there be no rj45 ethernet port which i consider a major fail even though this machine be target at people who think wireless be the way to go for everything there be stoday i learnedl time when nothing beat a wired connection and some time when it be absolutely require at least for a serious user that say i be tear about dock they a star for not at least include a 5 usbc to rj45 network adapter which i have to buy separately to test it a minor inconvenience but it should have be include on a computer in this price range give that i be not in the target demographic or hardly anyone target demographic for that matter i will give they the benefit of the doubt it work fine with the adapter also a you will know if you follow my review i be a linux geek support for realee software obviously one of the most important thing i test be will this run linux the answer be yes i be able to boot after change the boot sequence in bios f2 on startup linux mint mate 18 64 bit for realom an external dvd drive the flash drive boot disk i make do not work i also email acer help folk and they say i could install another o but it would void my software warranty on window who care i have also find a person online who have instal mint on a similar acer laptop it run well consider it be run for realom a dvd and i be even able to use the networkoverusb function to connect to the internet with no trouble at all since the driver be stoday i learnedl available on the main ssd i will have to make sure those get migratedreplace when i permanently install mint the next step will be open she up and either remove the win 10 ssd or simply instal over it along with instal a 1 tb hard drive wd black for datum if the ssd be an m2 style drive there be suppose to be room for both and i will wait and see what i find when i open the back which can be tricky accord to some online video i hope to turn this beastie into a very nice mint laptop and will update this review with any significant further finding at this point i have to give a firm 5 star to this machine and would encourage those who actually like win 10 to read review by people who feel likewise i also have little use for the flippy tablet touchscreeny stuff although i may find a use for it eventually finger tend to be too big for serious work especially on a 1920x1080 screen maybe with a stylus touchscreen in general be more for finger paintinglevel play rather than real productive work uhoh just insult a couple of generation i would also encourage linux user to consider this laptop it be big but thin and seem to run mint well other distros may vary but probably the debianubuntu family would see similar result i be very pleased with this computer and excited to see acer be indeed a maker of very good computer now instead of cheap clone good job acer i will be keep my eye on you for realom now on maybe you should consider support linux more openly if you be look for a laptop in this size range i encourage you to give this a serous look i do not think you will be disappoint update may 5 2017 i open up the back which be not difficult but require patience and discover that the system drive be an m2 2280 ssd hynix hfs256g39tndn210a to be exact there be also a space which might hold a regular 25 inch hard drive but no connector or fitting to secure it i draw the conclusion that this machine be set up purely a an ssd base machine no worry i can use the 1 tb 25 inch drive a external storage and back up i be order a crucial 525 gb m 2 and will see if that can replace the original drive to make this a mint 181 machine i will report back an update with my progress on that take off the back be not hard but you must be careful after remove the 12 or so little machine screw you have to carefully pry the back loose with a fine object i try guitar pick but they be not hard enough i end up very carefully use the tip of a fold knife kershaw and very gently pry the lip of the back piece 90 degree out away for realom the body of the laptop untoday i learned i feel the tiny snap of the plastic lug let go once you figure this out it be very easy to remove the back a it be one solid piece and not connect to any electronic or wire really a pretty good design it also snap back into place easily i be inform by acer that change the drive would not void my warranty unless i damage the machine in the process but it would void the software warranty so keep that in mind if you want to open yours up to make such change i will be pull the original drive out and keep it in original condition in case i ever feel the need to punish myself with window 10 again i m stoday i learnedl quite impressed and happy with this laptop update june 11 2017 stoday i learnedl very happy with this machine i successfully instal mint 181 on the crucial ssd and it be run happily the usbc to ethernet adapter seem to work just fine a a wired network connection and i be get other accessory to use that and the usb 30 port i really love this machine i ve include some pic of it run mint with various application like hydrogen drum machine and gimp image manipulation,Good

this motherboard be pretty great i go for realom an asrock 970fx to this and be very pleased that i do so the board be definitely an asus product and you can see that in the quality design it have a very nice look to it and look great mount inside a case my main attraction point be the seven sata port and ability to utoday i learnedize for realont io usb 30 a feature i have never have on a mother board before my main issue be the placement for fan input and the small metal cushing for where you screw the motherboard to the standoff first there be five place for fan input two by the cpu for push pull configuration which be great then there be three more one by the sata port and two by the pci slot my confusion be why there be two by the pci slot i can understand how fan on the top and back of the case need pin point but where they be make it a wee bit difficult to manage the cable in a nice looking manner a far a the metal cushing go they be destroy very quickly this be not a huge issue but i would have like they to be there for extra security i would also like to note that i do not use any mechanical tool all screw be hand tighten with a pen screwdriver so i do not apply too much force overall it be a great product i take one start off for the two minor issue i have in the end i would happily buy this board again and would recommend other to do the same a well 45,Good
i have own the gd08b case for over six month now and i be content with my purchase what originally attract i to this case be it htpc form factor design couple with the ability to accommodate fullsized motherboard and other hardware i notice plenty of reviewer have good thing to say about it build quality but a few people complain about some difficulty get the exterior drive bay button to line up with their optical drive i would agree that it overall build quality be impressive however i do not personally experience any problem get the drive bay button to line up consider this be an htpc form factor case there be a good amount of room to install plenty of hard drive and solid state drive and system cooling should not be an issue for most user thank to all the available fan mount but cable management option be very limited if you have an atx or even eatx motherboard collect dust somewhere and you be think about build an htpc for your living room or bedroom look no far,Good

of the several different fan the ejoy have to offer i choose the 45 inch mini usb 3 speed rechargeable portable table fan mostly for it be rechargeable and not limit to just be use with a usb connection or the need to purchase battery all the time yes i will use it while i m sit with my computer with the usb plug in but with this one i can take anywhere i may need it the fan itself work great and put out a good breeze on it low setting which would be fine for most situation but it also have the 2 high speed which really put out a strong breeze but i imagine when run on the battery it will not last a long on any of the 3 speed the fan run very smoothly with no vibration so it stay put where you set it and it also pretty quiet when i first take it out of the box i be pleasantly surprised at the quality of this fan it make for realom a very solid and rugged plastic and not flimsy or cheap feeling at all like a lot of other fan of this type be overall i be extremely happy with this purchase and the quality of the fan and i thank ejoy for allow i to purchase this slick fan at a discount to try out and write a review if in any way i do not like this fan i absolutely would have report on it,Good

what i do not like the projector box be put inside a shipping bag with no padding whatsoever when i pull the box out of the bag it look pretty banged up see pic something a for realagile a this definitely need to be pack in a box for future shipment there be nothing wrong when i pull the projector out of the box due to it be pad pretty well inside but if i would have experience any issue that would have be my first reason to come back to now out of the box it fire right up when you re in a dark room it big and it bright the description say you can go anywhere for realom 2 foot to 13 foot the truth be you can not go past 8 foot and stoday i learnedl have a decent picture at least not on a white wall with flat paint that be say once it all adjust it really do have a nice picture be it 1080p not in my experience but again i be throw it to a wall and not a screen if i put it on a screen at 80 maybe that remain to be see if i decide to invest in a screen down the line ill update the screen adjustment be easy once you have it setup in the location you want rotate the big dial on the for realont the hone it in to the good clarity one of the thing that disappoint i about this projector be the keystone it have a vertical keystone mean it can adjust the screen updown but it lack a horizontal keystone so you can not adjust the screen leave or right in my case i have it mount off the left and shoot to the right but could not adjust the screen so it always look funky i be pretty disappointed in that you can mount this but you have to find a decent mini projector mount which have not be easy to find essenthanks in advancelly it just a quarter inch camera screw which i m sure you could pick up along with some other stuff at a local hardware store and make your own let get on to some of the performanceinternal stuff one of the main reason i dock a star be a very misleading description you have several input you can choose for realom two hdirect messageis pc av antenna usb sd or android one of the thing that rake i in about this projector be the bluetooth capability for sound i figure i could bluetooth a soundbar to this and have a kicka rig wrong sure you can bluetooth a soundbar or any wireless speaker to it but it only work on the android input it will not work on any of the other input if you want an external speaker besides the one that come with it for those other input like hdirect messagei or av invest in a 35 mm cable go to that external speaker the build in speaker that it come with be impressive but on device that you can not control the volume on like my att uverse cable box you can not adjust the volume even turn all the way up on the projector it be hard to hear definitely need an external sound source speak of the android input it pretty useless at the moment now when more app start become available for it like the weather channel or news app or even thing like netflix amazon and hulu then i think it may have some more desire a projector with those type of streaming program would be highly desirable probably more to come in the future on that but it definitely lack right now what it be useful for be if you have an sd card or a flash drive with musicmovie that you want to watch that s a pretty cool feature be warn use the remote on the android side can get aggravate it not very user for realiendly at least in the setting menu take i 5 minute just to sign into my google account with it enter info be a royal pain again android side have potenthanks in advancel just have not be unlocked yet the input be all great my wife and i both have surface and we have several wireless display adapater for different tv around the house to stream video or browse the web on a big tv it great for browse vacation package together at first i could not get the wda to work on the projector but after a firmware update to the adapter it perform nicely occasionally i would start it up and the display adapter screen would be green and you have to go back and forth through a few input to get it to be black again before you connect your surface once you get past that minor hassle it work pretty smooth i watch a few different video and it work fine not very good for web browsing or use your pc in general a it not very crisp and hard to read thing like web page i use both the vga input and wireless display adapter to test this no improvement over either again this be project on to a wall and not a screen with the right reflective property i will say that i wish the hdirect messagei input be a little more spread out when i have my display adapter in i can not plug in anything to the other port i m sure there be a way around this but a little for realustrating if you want to mount it and leave it finally the color and clarity now again one last time this be my experience project on to a wall and not a screen which i m sure would make some difference i sort of cover clarity above no horizontal keystone and edge seem to be blurry no matter what you do however the middle of the screen be crisp i m sure it depend on the movie video color be on that same level it not great but it not terrible forget have decent black but that s with almost every led product on the market the red and blue pop nicely the green be ok you can change and mess with setting but i find little difference between they overall i go back and forth a lot in my head i ve have this for about 24 hour and a you can see i ve test it quite extensively i stoday i learnedl have some more i d like to put it through like project to the side of the house to watch movie outside but i think i already know the outcome of that you will find other projector on amazon that perform comparable to this for around 100 so do not be fool by the price tag i think it a decent projector for a lot of application want to keep the kid occupy with a kid movie outside or in the basement buy it want to game on it with a ps4xbone or turn your current setup into a home theater and expect to see amazing graphic i d maybe go a different route do not set your expectation too high with this one it great very portable and very easy to setup and use for simple thing like watch a movie outside or on a wall but if you re look for an outstanding experience that will blow you away this be not nor be any projector that be under 1000 for you would i buy this again probably not i d spend a bit more and go for a nice tv point it it do what it say it will do it just need some adjustment and maybe a bit of creativity on your end so to sum up pro portable easy to use great potenthanks in advancel on android side plenty of input decent screenbrightness when close than 8 foot for realom projection surface con keystone limitation input too close color be only meh no bluetooth sound outside of android input hard to find decentaffordable mount clarity need work especially on pc input only work well in very dark condition minimal light the last thing i will comment on be the customer service it be excellent i have a question inithanks in advancelly about tracking and they be very quick to respond to all of my email some of the good customer service i think i have ever have incredibly fast shipping and for realiendly seller be always one of the top attribute in my book if i could give 35 star for that reason i would this product be provide at a discount price in exchange for my honest review,Average
love this bag for organize my cable when i travel instead of a tangle mess in my backpack it super convenient just to grab and go when i travel iphone cable apple watch charger micro usb charger etc i also throw in the usb plug and some spare aa battery this all fit within the little bag and i do not really use the large one,Good
i love this usb hub it be great it be fast and the sd carder reader read up to 70 mb a sec what more could you ask for and it be under 20 what more could you ask shunt up and take my money it be that good,Good
i really really love this computer small yet powerful fast yet quiet by profession i m a network administrator or at least be i have build or manage more computer than i care to count but i must say this little guy be my favorite i purchase this to set up a computer with 24 in monitor for my indoor bicycle trainer it have far exceed my expectation window 10 boot up in about 7 second the quick i ve see please note this be a barebone system which mean you stoday i learnedl need to purchase at minimum the ssd hard drive and ram if you want to use it wirelessly then you also need a wireless nic below be all the component i use to build my system all of which be purchase here on amazon also intel nuc boxd54250wykh1 intel 4th gen intel core i54250u with intel hd graphic 5000 barebone system samsung 850 evo 250 gb msata 2inch ssd mzm5e250bw use a primary c drive for operating system samsung 850 evo 250 gb 25inch sata iii internal ssd use a storage d drive for data crucial 8 gb kit 4gbx2 ddr3 1600 mt pc3 12800 cl11 sodimm notebook memory module good ram for the price amazonbasics highspeed minihdirect messagei to hdirect messagei cable 65 foot 2 meter support ethernet 3d and audio return use to connect computer to hhd monitor which support sound for realom the computer to the monitor below intel network 7260 hmwgr revise wifi wirelessac 7260 ht dual band 2x2 acbluetooth hmc for wireless and bluetooth connection important if you want to connect to your tablet or wireless network eagletec k104 ks04 24 ghz wireless combo keyboard and mouse need inithanks in advancel to computer setup but now i use my tablet a my keyboardmouse however these be stoday i learnedl need for when i do not have my tablet benq gaming monitor rl2455hm 24inch lead excellent display for gaming but i use it for my cycling app zwift veloreality racermate which look marvelous after change some display set to my like,Good
nice mid tower and a decent size it worth the 35 i pay it a little flimsy and i would not pay the 55 they tend to target the consumer look for something else if it not on sale otherwise if it 35 scoop it up i do not game and i buy they for shop workstation also some come with side glass and other do not and you get whatever they ship to you look at my photo and those be both the same model i personally do not care but some of you may,Good
for the full crispy 4 k video review search on youtube for edit 4k on external ssd the 128 gb macbook pro 2015 can edit 4 k content however it just do not have enough storage space fortunately there be a fast enough external ssd that can help the samsung t1 usb 30 come in 250 gb 500 gb and 1 tb capacity with a benchmark of 400 mbps read and write you can edit 4 k at home and on the go,Good
this unit be not go to win any designaward and to quickly run backup it do not need to so far my station live up to that promise and i can even boot for realom a disc in the docking station your mileage may vary depend on your mobo bios the big issue i have be with the performance usb3 can be very fast and this docking station be way fast than any usb2 model the maximum should be 600mbs and i do not expect it to achieve that the maximum i measure be 120mbs that s fast when you connect a single drive but only average when both drive be run summary need to backup your hd drive go with this performance will not matter much stoday i learnedl way fast than usb2 and close to the average speed of a hd single external drive performance stoday i learnedl be good not that much slow than an internal sata port except for the short burst unless you use a ssd concurrently accessing both hds eg a laptop with large external storage there an improved chipset or usb3 driver would be welcome 120mbs be 20 of the maximum leave a lot of room for acceleration,Good
this thing be cheap and it suck i think my internet be go slow because of my internet connection but when i plug in my ethernet cord it be sure enough the adapter i can only surmise that most of these review be fake or people do not realize they be get massively jippe for realom the performance of this adapter i finally find what you be probably look for if you be look for a cheap wireless adapter httpwwwamazoncomlinksysae2500dualbandwirelessnadapterdpb0054yqo5crefsr113ieutf8qid1452456269sr813keywordswifiadapter it 20 buck but i can confirm that it can get speed of 80 mbps and it do not constantly lag vote up this review and let other people know that this be a piece of crap i attach an image of my 100 mbps internet with this wifi adapter get 6 mbps,Bad
i buy this card reader for my 2016 macbook pro which lack an internal sd slot i test a 128 gb transcend uhs1 u3 card with a rate speed of 95mbs read and 60mbs write and come up with 13mbs on both read and write use blackmagic disk speed test i then repeat the test on my 2013 mbp use the same card and compare the speed of the internal card reader and the vanja usb card reader see attach screenshot the vanja cripple transfer speed even though my system recognize the card a be on a usb 30 bus it operate well under spec got to send this one back,Bad
great organizer i use this for my emergency tech kit and it great for cable of all size and even have a zipper pouch for a battery work great and get the job do perfect for student or anyone that travel for realequently or have a decent commute to and for realom work would recommend this to anyone so for those who care here be what i have in mine google chromecast anker 10000mhp battery and charger amazon wall outlet dongle usb to usb a cable amazon basic hdirect messagei cat 5e cord anker 3 ft micro usb cable anker 3 ft lightening cable 2x apple earpod,Good
sequenthanks in advancel readwrite speed be pretty good but random read and write be a bit disappointing,Good
have the hdirect messagei dongle connect to your network first and let it automatically update the software it take 2030 minute since the first update attempt fail after that i can connect an iphone se through airplay and an android 51 through cast i use it on my car via an hdirect messageicomposite video converter audio quality be low than am radio if you will be use it for music where it really shine be the video quality on android cast or apple airplay when connect to a 1080p capable tv monitor,Good
i need to take time to review also this look like something out of a japanese dollar store when i open the brown box and see the original packaging and i kid you not i be in a great one recently this feel oddly light but it more than serve it purpose i try to find it all with no help on research so this be it this be on our large granite island we try to keep look neat in past i have purchase several satechi wall unit take pic off to not confuse reader which i like but beware of insane plug placement try to find multi usb multi outlet surge protection fast charging try to find that in one work well with plug placement what be these dude thinkin seriously plus not visually blare out i have too many device on the huge granite island useful info the 2 power button you see be for all usb and for all electrical outlet for turn main power off to either thought there be more individual control within the usb and outlet to shut each off or at least 12 of the unit guess that s complicated to design,Good
i buy this for my home office desk i also have a much large and more expensive vornado fan about 8 foot away however i have not use that since i buy this little fan it be simply great it be a product that be very well build and have a very thoughtful design it be very adjustable and while it do not create hurricaneforce wind i rarely find myself have the thing dial up to max i have a fain real lifey large work space and i m regularly 23 away for realom it and it put out a feelgood breeze that easily cool i down i have it plug into a high amperage port on my desktop so it turn on and off with my main workstation i regularly turn it off manually when i do not need the breeze all that say i just could not be happy i would easily pay twice a much and be just a ecstatic about it my only complaint would be that sometimes if i m really pay attention to my screen and forget to blink it can help to dry out my eye but that s really my issue and not the fan i do accidentally get my finger stuck in it once and it do hurt but not too bad again that s my fault and i would not want it to have a cage a that would impact the size and aesthetic,Good
i have too many na drive and a ups on a shelf under my desk the stagnant air would sometimes because overtemp alert for realom one or more drive this fan cure the situation once and for all even though it have only one mount keyhole a single screw easily mount it upside down and the rubber foot prevent it for realom work loose the fan be surprisingly quiet even on high it have be run 247 for 2 month without a single issue,Good
oct 29 2015 this thing be cool it light and silent and do exactly what it describe like what more can you ask for now i m actually look forward to when my computer get hot hehe do not jinx i universe apr 17 2017 it be nearly 2 year since i buy this and it stoday i learnedl work just fine i keep it on literally 247 because i have a really old horrible laptop yes the one in the pic one of the light start to flicker one time but it no big deal,Good

i love this earbud and everyone who manage to see it fall in love with it be mesmerize with how small inconspicuous it be my job require i to be out about all day so i need something small not noticeable a well a allow i to hear my surrounding this earbud be perfect in that regard i ve purchase a few other mini bluetooth earbud this be by far the good fit for the ear a well a battery life the battery life be a good 4 hour of continuous music play which be what i primarily use it for i ve get a few phone call with it in my ear the people who call say they can hear i very well which be a great thing because where i work be kind of noisy with that being say a much a i love these earbud they have one major flaw the charge cable be terrible i buy two of these earbud with every one i ve receive they ve seem to gone down in quality the first one i buy be great work fine but the second one i buy the cable do not work out of the box i send gonovate an email they reply tell i they will send a replacement they do very fast might i add sadly the next day i plug it up the new cable snap immediately so i be stuck with 3 earbud one cable that i have to pray do not break because it will render these earbud useless i do not know what kind of cable this be but if i could find a reliable one it d make this buying experience a little well so a far a the earbud itself it great the charge cable sadly play a huuuge part into this product,Average
great card reader and usb port reader we want something up on the desk that would be easily accessible and this be perfect for that we have it on the computer desk and plug into the computer now whenever we need to plug something in we do not need to look for a port we want a card reader so we do not need another adapter to plug in card i take picture and it be a lot fast to have something to plug the card into than to plug in the camera and upload the picture simple and easy to use,Good
this thing be great i get it for my father because his cell phone charger be bulky and take up too much room this fix it and add more outlet and usb charge spot now the option be endless it swivel you have to push an unlock button underneath the outlet nice green lead light to show operation the two usb port be great for multiple device what be unexpected be that it come with a usb cable that s right it come with a usb 20 to mini usb cable about 3 long the 3 pronged outlet have a plastic safety cover that can be easily remove for transportation in bag and travel nothing negative to say,Good
update i have a 128 gb microsd card insert into this reader and when i click get info it only show this be a 32 gb card that s a serious loss of storage it also do not show up under mac disk utoday i learnedity despite show up in finder so i can not try to perform first aid or reformat it to see if i get full capacity back see photo i ve spend the last 30 minute try to figure out what s wrong i do not know if i have a defective adapter but this microsd card read perfectly in other device so again one can only conclude i either have a defective unit or they be not capable of readingwrite beyond 32 gb this card reader work it do exactly what it suppose to receive a microsd card and make it readablewritable in your usbc equip device however i really would have like it if the microsd card be fully cover by the reader instead of protrude halfway out yes the image in the ad indicate this be how it be but i d stoday i learnedl like it to be the way i say why because i d like to actually leave my microsd card insert in my late2016 15 macbook pro with touch bar at all time so that i always have the additional 128 gb of storage available it would also be nice if the piece at the end of the usbc connector be actually the same dimension a the main body of the adapter essenthanks in advancelly i would like to see this device look more like a solid block have the microsd card be springloaded and fully enclose so that it look and function like a small extension of the usbc port instead of something that can easily be break if bump while insert the lead indicator light be a nice touch though when i m use my laptop on battery power this be just one more thing to deplete it fast and it actually unnecessary if i see the icon on my desktop i know i m connect if i do not see it then obviously i m not i do not need a light tell i it in stoday i learnedl overall i like the concept it do expand my onboard storage capacity by double i just wish i be comfortable with leave it in whenever it be time to go mobile if you find this review helpful please indicate such a i m aspire to become an amazon vine reviewer thank you i be not compensate in any manner shape or form for this honest review i pay full retail for my item and be give my unbiased review of my own accord with no discount offer of a discount etc,Bad
unfortunately the bad review be true this thing really do get blaze hot during use copy 5 gb of file to the 128 gb drive result in a surface temperature of 67c which be way too hot to touch hold the ambient temperature at the time be 23c this high temperature would not be so bad except that the drive also shut down disconnect when it get that hot that mean that copy any large file will result in file corruption deletion this make this somewhat large storage device completely useless except when use to store a handful of small and only occasionally use file,Bad
too big to fit through the protective cover of my phone also the cable limit the current to 1 amp even when attach to a 5v 21a usb i attach the load my iphone and pull 2 amp through the apple cable,Bad
reasonably price this portable mediadvd player have numerous feature include in the package be a mini dvd game disc game controller ac adapter 3 foot cable remote control three foot long car chargerpower cord antenna and an audiovideo output patch cord to plug the device into a tv that have composite video input port the remote control take 2 aaa battery not include first step be to fully charge the unit with the ac adapter which do not become excessively warm during charge for a new device to breakin a rechargeable battery by fully charge and then fully deplete before recharge and repeat that cycle three or four time if possible within a couple week to obtain optimal durationperformance for realom the battery a glance at the instruction manual be not illuminate so i proceed test this review sample player by trial and error the antenna include plug in and i push the mode button untoday i learned radio appear on the screen and then stop the device automatically search for fm radio station and when it land on one i like i press the enter button on the remote to stop on it the sound quality for realom the two small speaker locate under and on either side of the monitordisplay be more than adequate i repeat this process in the vhf tv mode but no station be detect next i place a dvd movie in the player press enter and it start right up and play without any problem well there be one problem the battery be fully deplete after 103 minute so i could not finish the movie without plug in the ac adapter something to note if take the player on the road the picture be crystal clear with no breakingup or for realeeze the movie sound good through the speaker but i listen to most of it with headphone not include and the sound be excellent after watch the movie i charge the battery and note that the green fully charge light mention in the instruction manual be glow even though the battery be deplete there be no red charge light that be suppose to turn green when fully charge but i note the green light eventually go off after about three hour so i assume that be the indication the player be fully charge to test the game i plug the game controller into the back usb port do not use the one on the left side it be for a flash drive i never figure out a way to use just the remote control or the control on the player console to select a game it take a combination of action which i readily admit might be more elegantly do but it work so i look no far when the game disc be instal press the playpause icon button locate on the right side of the console in the center of the large silver disc which bring up the menu page for the numerous game include next press the down arrow locate in this same large silver disc and it will page through the game to select a game press a digit key on the remote control that correspond with the game for example when the screen have the page five game display i select the number four on the remote keypad and the galaga game appear on the screen it play just a i remember it for realom long ago and although the controller be very basic and would not be comfortable for extended play but it too perform adequately this medium player perform many function but it be not build to withstand a lot of abuse not surprising give it modest price point so it may be well in the hand of an adult rather than a child it should not be leave in a hot car or expose to water etc so far it be work well but if i encounter any issue i will update the review,Good
this amazon basic mouse have le of a hump than the logitech m100 cord mouse i buy the amazon basic mouse for our school where lady and child would use it with small hand i like the large m100 logitech mouse for myself men if you do not need the mouse to fill up the inner curve of your mansize hand then this amazon basic mouse will be fine,Good
i have this in my lenovo ideapad 100 which be a mini laptop with only 32 gb 17 gb usable memory so i need a storage device that would handle all the data storage for this laptop i purposefully get a lowprofile type flash drive so it would fit snugly into the laptop usb port and not be obtrusive to my use a a storage device it work great no problem at all and ill keep use it a i be but it not a lowprofile a i have hope it would be a you can see in the photo it stick out for realom the port about 14 inch i do not know if this be because the 128 gb size be large than the other but it something to keep in mind if you re look for a flash drive that will sit flush with your laptop,Good
work out great for i i have 12 flash drive mine they do not fall out either,Good
it work for the samsung galaxy s8 otg i can now transfer file to and for realom my zip drive very good quality will update after more use,Good
got this to replace my 256 gb corsair voyager gtxoverall it really nice drive after do some speed test with crystaldisk it be clear that my corsair voyager be a bit fast whether run ntfs or exfat i have see a few reviewer that have post pic of crystaldisk that seem to show number much high in some area than i could get which i find a little strange but i m sure there be other factor in play here the build quality be nice though it would be great if it come with some kind of chain to allow you to attach it to a keychain without worry about the plastic part break under torsion i love that i do not have to keep track of a lid and i love that it fit in any usb slot without block neighboring port a major issue with my voyager i fill up usb drive really quickly and this be the perfect size physically for nearly 500 gb 470 available of storage my corsair voyager act a bit differently when connect to a pc so i have to be careful when eject it but this pny drive be great about not get stick and unable to eject like other high capacity flash drive i have come across overall a great tool for file storage or it tech that need to have lot of stuff on hand and ready to use at any time,Good
impressive speaker loud clear bass be a little lacking but it do have some it light speak party but volume speak mini super party great portability include travel bag last 1 hour and 30 minute with continuous use after full charge this seem like it might vary for realom other at this price range this be one of the good speaker i have find and the light be just pure fun if you like flash light that be of all color nice metal enclosure case have a nice quality double layer fabric and pleather feel to part of it at max volume you will hear some crackle or distortion especially if you have loud bass note just turn it down a notch or too and it stoday i learnedl loud enough for most medium sized room overall this speaker be very small and portable great for an hour or 2 of fun size be very similar to the size of a baseball if you be look for something that hit hard deep bass note and will be ear deafen then this be not for you you will need a higher powered more expensive unit,Good
it work and seem to be reliable adata put have one that s a little bit fast benchmark test use a ssd benchmark seq read 45 mb seq write 8 mb 4k read 4 mb 4k write 01 mb acc time read 857 m acc time write 464656 m i attach screenshot include iop,Good

this product be great definitely worth buy this be a small portable router with medium streaming capability and a long a you use the proper video format you will not have any issue i have use any video convert and handbreak prefer to convert video to place into a usb drive to use with this device i have have 5 video stream go at once with no lag or for realeeze up i use 2 iphone 1 ipad and 2 video stream via my macbook pro to test it a there will be 4 people stream during our upcoming trip while do all the streaming if you have it connect to the internet via either wifi or wire preferred you can also browse the internet and yes it will be a little slow that you might be use to a it be only like an n 150 but it work fine one last thing this device be selfpowere due to it internal battery bank and will last a very long time a long a you be use a thumb drive and not a harddrive update i forget to mention that you will need to do a firmware upgrade when you get it at least i do and it take care of all and any issue i see when i first try to use the device during my trip i be able to hook up my roku to it via the wireless and it work fine for about 3 hour then i have to reboot the device not the roku but the router this be not an issue but i figure i mention it a well the battery last i the entire flight about 8 hour of use and i stoday i learnedl have 3 bar out of 4 when i get to my destination i use a portable hard drive to stream movie to 3 apple device,Good
i have purchase a lot of anki product before but this be my first cable it be package nicely in a box and come with a reusable velcro cabletie the chord be about a stiff a you would expect a braid cable to be but it feel well make and of high quality both the micro usb and standard usb plug be nice with a little branding none of they be annoyingly large where they have issue fit into thing although both actual port fit a bit too snug into the female port it be not a deal breaker but be the one and only reason i decide to deduct a star i buy this primarily a a cable to plug my controller into my ps4 but i have also use it to charge a speaker charge headphone connect my logitech smart hub to my computer to sync and connect my sony camera to my computer everything that i have so far use it for have work great for power and datum transfer ill have to update my review when it put to the test of long term use and the test of time in general but so far i do like it for around 8 i think this be a good deal for a high quality cable for realom a company that have not let i down yet and i can easily recommend this,Good
no way to plug anything in i have to cut my case to make it work,Average
really like this drive the little camera be what prompt the purchase yes it be an impulse buy but i really like it work well it be after all a thumb drive and no complaint regard performance the only thing that make it a not a 5 star rating be the fact that the little camera have eos 3d print on the camera that clearly say nikonyes little detailbut i want a nikon not a nikon with eos 3d on it note eos 3d be a canon model not a nikon model manufacturer pay more attention to detail take pride on your work,Good
the rocketek usb 30 memory card reader be an excellent buy at this price point i be in need of a new card reader for some extra card lay around and this fit the bill i only use it for the micro sd slot which be conveniently locate under a cap at the back of the unit for a clean look it nice that there be also a couple other slot for the big sd card if i ever need they this be the slim model that do not have the ability to read two card at once so make sure you select the correct product if that s something you require the only reason i give this 45 star be because the usb connection be tight i have to give it a deliberate push into my pc usb port and i m a little worried i might break either my port or the usb stick i try it on another pc and it be an even more tight fit i accidentally pop off the swinge cover try to push it in but luckily it do not break it could just be the particular unit i get so your mileage may vary but it something to look out for maybe it will loosen up with use overall i m happy with my purchase and i highly recommend this card reader it not enormous or unaesthetic like many of the other i check out bonus point for those who just want to use it with a microsd card because it keep it well protect,Good
the clamp lamp by avantek be a really great lamp pack full of feature at an affordable price i be look for exactly this type of lamp for my loft lead light with adjustable brightness and tone a good secure clamp and a very long cord the most unique thing about the clamp lamp be the battery there be a rechargeable battery in the control for realee you to put this wherever light be need provide you charge it once and a while the lamp be power by a usb plug no outlet require however i use a usb adapter to power and charge mine this be a really unique and useful lamp i be very very happy with it and will probably purchase more,Good

this adapter have pretty good performance for a few month what i do not like about this product be that the unit be too big if you be use in a stationary position it would be alright but when you attach it to a laptop and occasionally move around with it that be too cumbersome to place laptop conveniently it will always hit wall or other environment while move around with a laptop it hit something every time i move and it be give leverage pressure to the usb port and make i scare it might break my usb port on the laptop while it be about the size of a big usb flash drive this linksys adapter be too much burden for a usb flash drive you do not keep it attach to your device all the time but rather attach it and remove it when you be use it however you always keep it attach to your device for your wireless network adapter so this make more cumbersome finally today this adapter break while my dog be jump over my laptop and accidentally hit the adapter the adapter have pretty good performance other than turn off itself and not be able to connect with the router for about 30 time for 6 month of use i contact a linksys technical support today but be not able to get any help about it i ve be use linksys product for more than 10 year but this be so much disappointing i just wish it have small design for a much well use after the review linksys decide to not give i a replacement for this unit i understand but why do they even reply to my review and tell i to contact they waste my time for nothing i guess no more linksys for i anymore,Bad

the satchi usb headphone stand hold my akg k7xx headphone very well while look great on my desk it have a pretty sturdy build although the base be slightly light which could allow for it to get knock around my desk it will not fall over by itself though the internal dac that the headphone play through in this stand be not great make the stand not a good place to plug your headphone into when buy this stand i be hope to be able to plug it into a quick charge usb port or wall socket but unfortunately the usb output in this stand will not go over 500 ma i figure this out with a little current testing i kind of have my hope up with use the stand a a charge port but it will not charge at high amperage so it be fast to plug your phone into a wall to charge all in all i love the stand to put my headphone on even though the audio jack be not useful for i or the stand do not charge quickly for 30 it be a nice stand with some nice extra feature like a data usb splitter build in,Good
update since my original review i figure out how to brighten and even turn off the backlighting on the keyboard by hit the fn f10 key a couple time rtfm wait what manual unfortunately the flex and bounce of the keyboard in the center be get a bit bad with for realequent usage 410 hoursday so when my finger be ablaze with speedy typing i do notice some letter miss user error entirely possible but not likely at this ratio compare to my builtin laptop keyboard stoday i learnedl it a cute little keyboard but probably not the good choice for heavy typistbusiness user style great very sleek and contemporary look performance soso it have a flexgive in the middle so if you re type quickly or pound away you ll notice a few letter sometimes get leave out because the center of the keyboard flex down a bit some reviewer mention have this issue but i find it pretty easy to overcome in the pic i attach you can see i use it with my laptop and extend display both of which be touchscreen so i often forgo use of the mouse and keyboard altogether since i m touch the screen i purchase this extended keyboard for ergonomicbackslouche reason but i much prefer the performance of my laptop keyboard over this little gmyle guy feature my bigood gameest issue be the lack of that extra row of key for home end pg up pg down see pic of my laptop keypad my productivity be much high when i only have to tap my right pinky finger on the end or home button to jump to the start or end of a row of text etc without those key you have to hit the fn function key on the left with the directional key on the low right this only impact productivity though so if you re not a madtypist haha it should not affect usage the other problematic feature be the blue backlighte that at night in a darkly light room tend to make the key blurry and hard to see,Average
first of all there be not many situation that call for a male to male usb cable but luckily i have a set of tip that convert a male usb plug to just about any other plug one would want and be able to put this to use a a regular usb cable i hook it to a usb 30 drive a well a a usb 20 drive and the cable perform a it should this be a very well build cable with construction that seem fit to survive a nuclear war see the attached picture compare it to an old usb cable i have on hand this be not one of those chintzy cable you see all over ebay in fact i have several other amazon basic cable that have be in service for year which be all build like tank and be all stoday i learnedl work to this day i definitely see this last for quite a while nice product,Good
the western digital element external hard drive 2 tb1 tb be quite a beast on it own having own no previous external hard drive except for an external enclosure i have to say i feel pretty pleased to have buy this product the hard drive be sleek form factor be simple enough to look elegant sturdy enough not to feel like on the first drop it will break but a tad heavy for my taste although it be to be expect for realom a current tech hard drive it be ac power so you can expect reliability the miniusb and ac adaptor cable feature a respectable length about 1 meter this be a simple a an external hard drive could be out of the box it be plug and enjoy it come already format with ntfs filesystem but i recommend you partition and reformat at will which be nice because you can use it right away no software be include at all but it be not really necessary the usb 20 interface be a fast a you would expect it to be around 8 minute for a 10 gb copy roughly a speed of 20 mb so for my current need it be fast enough but you might want to check something else like usb 30 if you be in a rush since i will be use it basically a a back up solution i will not need to be constantly move information inout overall i be very satisfied with my hard drive a a matter of fact this review both apply to the 1 tb and 2 tb edition a i buy one of each and the only difference between they be the capacity inside the black box i feel really pleased i recommend this product totally update august 2011 rip harddrive a a computer scientist i fail the basic of technology always backup lose 2 tb worth of info my advice always keep two hard drive an external one and an internal once of the same capacity so in case anything go wrong and if you have they synche with incremental backup what you lose be little if any i m obviously not go to discus backup technique here offsite backup for natural disaster incremental v full backup and so on so ill just say i m disappointed with wd always trust seagate and for some reason give they a chance and bang it go i have never own an external hd before but needle to say i treat it nicely never leave the room and be not on all the time but just momentarily to copy information or watch some medium i now unfortunately own a second hd but the 3 tb version buy it day before the 2 tb one would die and do not even manage to back it up which be the original idea of get the second one let hope for it to last long soon will take the enclosure and put it a internal to be honest i do not trust it to last so what give will update the review after some time but will not change the rating anymore a internal placement be obviously not support by wd,Bad
i echo the view of other who have own vantec in the past and be a bit disappointed with the drop in quality i have to move up a notch in drive spec my previous vantec be the cx nst300su vantec nexstar cx nst300subk 35inch sata to usb 20 and esata external hard drive enclosure black which be usb 20 i need to move up to usb 30 1 the solid pushin power switch in the back of the early model have be replace by a small slider switch which be much more difficult to operate when you re try to shut down a drive without shake it 2 there s that plastic inner liner i do not have problem with the screw insert a another reviewer do but then enclosure screw should never be turn tight just secure 3 the power adapter be about the same size a early adapter but mine come with an original u 2pin plugin section in which one of the pin be plastic that s right museum piece photo attach amazon replace it without fuss having say all that the enclosure and drive work fine it quiet i place my drive on a silicone baking sheet which absorb vibration and resonance for realom the wooden shelf,Good

audio cable what can be so exciting about that be not they all the same you may be ask yourself while read this review while yes there be ton and ton of different audio cable out here be warn they be not a cut and dry a you may think this set of audio cable by omaker promise clear consistent audio in a premium design that be sure to bring life to your audio source for realom what i have see and hear throughout two week of ownership have be a consistent and wonderful audio experience that may surprise the average audio enthusiast for realom my previous review you may have notice how impressed i be with omakers product but how be i suppose to review audio cable before this item come to my door i think they be all the same i could barely tell the difference between 2 channel analog and hdirect messagei audio how cold i hear a difference between these and other cable i have use before when the package arrive at my door in a very timely manner i be excited to dive in and check out if i could really hear a difference for realom the second i open the shipping box i already know this be a classic omaker quality product the box itself be fain real lifey plain a simple yet effective cardboard box that simply state omaker on the for realont of the box while it will not stand out too much among other on store shelf i feel this actually say something about the quality of omaker product it tell i that omaker let the product itself state what the company set out to do they do not want you to decide what be good by simply look at a flashy box and to i this state they be not afor realaid to let the product do the talking after open the product i notice how wellpacke everything be instead of package everything in one big bag they take the attention to detail above what i have find in another packaging by bag all three cable in separate bag the two 3foot cable be on top and the 6foot cable on the bottom i feel a if this be a great setup a there be 2 different length that be sure to be find need in your home all three cable be make exactly the same on the two tip you will find a plastic molding cover the metal tip that plug into your audio device underneath the connector you will find an aluminum cast with the omaker logo imprint with a white color scheme under this you will find a bright orange rubber separator that separate the rubber cord for realom the aluminum body on both side the cord itself be what every tech person know be the most important aspect of any audio cable if this be not make of quality material feedback might come into play and the cord might fail much fast than it should luckily omaker create a unibody rubber coating surround the innard of the 3 and 6foot cable while i foud this to be of the great quality i would have really like to of see some sort of antitangle design some other have a sort of shoestring design that keep your cord for realom tangle unfortunately this design do not feature this however the coating do provide a sort of an easy to untangle to design that should not be much of a problem the cord itself feel high quality throughout without any noticeable bump or uneven edge i feel a if this cable could easily go through some serious damage before actually fail something i would not say about many cord include the one that come with headphone such a the jbl line of headset after the inspection of the cable themselves i decide to try they out with a pair of jbl e5s i have that i use daily like i say early the audio cable do not work well especially under stress so i decide to buy a cheap aftermarket audio cable that i have be use for a few week now while i do not think there would be much of a difference between these cable and the one i have be use so i remain skeptical untoday i learned i turn the music on and turn up the volume instantly i notice a big difference in the sound quality there be zero feedback and the audio come through loud and clear i a firm believer in the fact that any cable be the same a another whether that be a 1 audio cord or a 100 audio cord i though they all sound the same today this change my mind forever i have since start use this set of audio cable exclusively since i receive they i consider they one of the good audio cord i have ever use and it seem a if every day i find a new way of use they rather that be connect my old mp3 player to my jbl charge 2 or connect my tablet to my surround system they just work and to that point i could not have ask any more of they at this price point overall i feel omaker make a wonderful set that should appeal to any audio enthusiast while no this cable will not replace any hdirect messagei cable anytime soon it should increase the quality of your audio experience if you own a pair of beat or a similar headset that allow a 35 mm headset input this set be an extent replacement for the original audio cable the 6foot long cable should reach to those hard to reach place around your room that be normally hard to reach with a normal cable i be impressed with the overall quality of the product while there be n antitangle technology to be find it be very easy to untangle if they do become tangle in your pocket omaker hit another home run with this product the audio quality of everything i have try have be crystal clear while the overall quality have be top notch omakers slogan be right we should open our mind they be the maker i receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review of this product,Good

very disappointed with this drivewill probably just throw it away extremely cheap plastic and a very poor design the picture make it look like you can put it on your key chain but the bevel of the plastic near the key chain hole be such that a your key jiggle around in your pocket and the drive move around with respect to it rotational location on your key chain re your key chain ring inevitably exert force on the back of the drive where the key chain hole be and this force push the usb connector back out of the protective she will it do not matter how thin the key chain be any key chain with metal large than 1 mm thickness be go to be a problem too long did not read key chain feature extrude the usb connector and thus put it at risk to damage see pic i want something like the silicon power firma flash drive but their capacity do not go up to 256 gb with those even though there s no protective she will at all the drive be build like a tank so i never worry by the way the other viewer be correct about speed the write speed be pretty slow although read speed be good,Bad

my laptop have a solid state hard drive which mean it be limit in storage to get around this i ve plug two 32 gb sandisk cruzer fit drive into two unused usb port and leave they there add about 60 gb to my memory this work well but i d stoday i learnedl like more memory when i see the kingston 64 gb data traveler i decide to give it a try think it would be about the same size a the cruzer fit it be not see photo while much small than the usual usb drive the kingston be huge compare to the cruzer fit it would probably work great in a stereo system but i would not be confident to leave it in my laptop all the time the way i use my laptopcarrie around and put inandout of my briefcase several time a dayid be afor realaid this thing would snag or even break off eventually positive it a lot of memory in a small form factor the price be great it would be ideal for a stereo system etc that do not get move around a lot if you do not move your laptop around a lot you probably could leave in the laptop negative it be slow it be not a small a it look in the picture,Good
allow i to say that 99 of mini itx case be build with the wrong idea in mind they accept itx mother board but build like a file cabinet that can host 4 or 5 itx board in side which make you wonder what s the point of make case itx format in the first place mini itx case should be small should be narrow should be no large than a single itx mother board and isk 110 get it right a of april 2015 this case be the perfect companion for amd a series apus because it allow you to build a high performance multimedia station that can play game in a case that s small than the ps4 or xbox while this case can also host intel processor but you really should not be bother with it because if sff and poor 3d graphic be your thing intel have small form factor but if you want good graphic performance with decent cpu performance in a small form factor then you only two choice be dell alienware alpha or amd apu in this case what i have in the box be a follow amd a107850 k underclocke to 3537ghz for realom 3740ghz on the cpu under voltage for realom 145 to 125v this will allow the processor to use about 60w of power 8 g ddr 3 high profile ram stock amd cool fan hdd ssd gigabyte f2a88xxnwifi thing to take note 1 this case do accommodate the stock fm2 fan you may want to replace the stock cooler for something that s low in noise but it can do it make sure you install the fan in the right direction or else the lid be not go to fit 2 the case do accommodate the high profile ram 3 the include psu be 90w but that s a useless information by itself what you should also know be that the power brick can provide up to 90w with 19v output the internal dc to dc rectifier that convert 19v to 12v 33v and 5v have the follow spec 12v 5a 5v 6a 33v 5a where the 12v be mainly use for power up the processor therefore the maximum psu it can support be 12560w that s right 60w even if you get the a107800 during extreme situation like run future mark you will have a sudden lose of power because of over current protection,Good
i have a handful of the old se9 usb 20 drive and like those this be a nice look usb drive but the old usb 20 be cheap and infinitely well look in my opinion this be rather longish and nowhere near a nice a the old one surprise surprise the gut be bad than the old usb 20 version the write speed be atrocious they could only possibly be acceptable if you plan to write stuff there one time for example it be ok for an operate system install drive although the many small write when you create it will take a long time any regular large file which plan to write or update be a nogo this be well than the new version of the usb 20 drive a kingston have cheapen that out too it hit or miss mostly miss if you get the early or cheap version of that well yet just avoid this dog and get the samsung bar it outperform this in every measurable way and be only a few dollar more for double the capacity and it look well too or stick with the old usb 20 se9 if you do not care about performance a it the good looking of the 3 in my opinion p a regular portable hard drive like a seagate slim will walk all over this drive so bad it not even funny if you really care about speed and capacity stick with one of those or similar compact disk drive,Bad
it a powerful little fan with 3 speed and a rechargeable battery it fain real lifey quiet on low speed i would not call it a travel fan it big than i d like to carry around but it great for my desk and meeting,Good

first impression nice packaging and when i pull it out i be surprised by how big it be feature this thing be awesome i really like it a lot it be big without be too big it support charge multiple device and allow for space in between the plug for large plug to not block the space next to they it allow you to select which level you want to have power by simply push in a button the usb port seem to do a good enough job charge i do not know that i could use they to replace my charger but seem to do a decent job of charge but not a fast a the oem charger one of my favorite feature be the retractable cable it be 6 and a half foot but can be pull into a storage area in the base by simply twist the unit i take it to a meeting at work and set it up and get a lot of question and many people who be interested in get one after use it wrap up this be a very nice way to plug in and power multiple device and i really like this device the retractable cable be an epic idea and well execute i would buy this again and recommend it to for realiend andor family member i be provide this product for a for realee or at a reduce price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review i strive to provide feedback that i feel be correct in an effort to help make good buying decision with your hard earn money 27 year in retail have provide i with a unique perspective into the quality of product in many different price range and i enjoy test and review these item i will not recommend a product with a 4 or 5 star unless i feel that i would buy it for it full regular cost,Good

i ve only have the scarlett 1820 for a day but i feel compel to review it i ve be use a tascam us1641 for year it a similar interface with 8 mic pre which i need for record drum but i want to upgrade to something more stable and with well preamp the tascam be a budget interface that definitely get the job do but bland preamp dodgy construction and buggy driver make it a lovehate relationship it be not untoday i learned i buy a new computer and upgrade to sonar x3 that the device finally become stable but a bug require that i reinstall the driver every few day and i could only get latency down to 15ms round trip i be really just look for an allaround upgrade well pre stable driver low latency i be consider tascams new iteration the us16x08 which would hopefully give i stable driver with ongoing support but besides that the device appear to be merely a reskin of the us1800 which be a reskin of my us1641 definitely not worth the price tag so i ve be look at the behringer uphoria umc1820 which have an almost toogoodtobetrue price the only question be if the thing will actually ever be release it be announce a year ago and there s stoday i learnedl no word on when we can finally get our hand on one so i finally consider the focusrite 18i20 it be a little out of my price range but all the review say it be pure quality focusrite have a reputation for stable driver and good support but i be most excited about the award win preamp i take the plunge and buy an openbox item at a good discount much to my expectation the build quality be excellent the knob be sturdy and turn smoothly unlike the plasticky feel of the tascam the input and output be all tight and sturdy a well after instal the driver the unit be literally plug play my computer recognize it instantly and route sound to my monitor sonar x3 also recognize it immediately and configure input and output automatically i m able to get latency down to 11ms with only the occasional stutter on large project for the tascam 15ms be a struggle the require scarlett mix control software be also quite useful and simple enough for basic operation also i be delighted to see that the software be lightweight and open and close instantly without any delay i notice that the interface itself do not have a knob to control the direct monitor v computer mix this be handle within the mix control software you can adjust the level of each input independently which be impossible on most consumer interface a well a the level of your daw dialing in a decent mix be a simple task beyond that you have full control over inputoutput routing option i have not experiment with anything more advanced but i know there be many possibility finally the highly praise preamp live up to their reputation i do not know what to expect but when i try punch in some vocal on a recording i have make only a day prior with the tascam the difference be immediately apparent compare to tascam the focusrite 18i20 have a much warm and full sound it be like play through a tube amp v a solid state amp audio record with the tascam be more harsh and sterile the focusrite warm thing up without sacrifice presence and clarity my only complaint be that the rack attachment plate be not removable and the chrome monitorheadphone volume knob be a little too shiny make it hard to see where they re set i be completely happy with this interface and can say that it fully live up to it reputation if you re look for pro quality but on a budget the 18i20 be definitely the way to go if you re just start out but need the input and output i d recommend the late product for realom tascam while i struggle with the us1641 it a solid product and i m sure the late iteration have well support and compatibility if anything significant occur ill be sure to update my review update 42215 i ve have the unit for a few day now and be able to experiment with the mix control software i m pleased to say that i really like it i ve read review say that the software be confusing and difficult to set up but i could not disagree more the software be only a complex a your routing be a quick visit to the focusrite webpage will give you all the information you need for realom there it just a matter of figure out exactly what you want to do for my purpose i want zerolatency monitoring of vocal while apply compression i merely have to plug a mic into an input in 3 and then route the signal to an output you can choose any of the line spdif or adat out the output line out 3 in this instance then go into the input on my compressor i then run a cable for realom the compressor output to a for realee input on the interface in 4 i just have to make sure to monitor the input that my compressor be feed and record the mic input that i start with in 3 in mix control this simply mean mute in 3 and bring up the fader on in 4 in the end i m able to monitor with compression or reverbdelay etc but record a dry signal it be all do with a few simple mouse click so for anyone wonder about mix control capabilitie it easy to use and you can route any input to any output while maintain full control over each channel in the headphone mix,Good
update 11182011 this compact and foldable 21 a 2100 ma charger can quickly charge kindle fire or apple ipadipad2 you need a different cable for each one it be not one of those ordinary usb charger that output only 05 a of current the kindle fire require just 18a of charge current so this charger be fine 18 21 it be functionally the same a apple 10 watt usb charger which output 21 a so it be also suitable for charge the ipad you also need to buy a 6 amazonbasics usb cable 20 a male to micro b 6 foot 18 meter do not use one intend for your cellphone it may not work the total cost be 16 stoday i learnedl much cheap than the dedicated kindle charger which sell for 25 apple 10w charger cost 35 you enjoy well utoday i learnedity with this chargercable combo because they be separate and the charger prong be foldable additionally the micro usb cable can be use for copy file for realom your computer to the fire and vice versa this be the kind of cable usb 20 on one end and micro usb on the other that some reviewer be say that amazon should have include in the fire box you can check what both look like in customer image on this web page the main draw of this amazonbasics usb wall charger be the 2100 ma current output which be require for most modern smartphone and ipadipad2 you get these gadget charge the fast with this charger but the shape of this charger will block adjacent power outlet if it be plug into the wall or even an extension power strip in this respect it be really not an improvement over apple 10w usb power adapter this be why i also bring along a ziotek zt1212518 power strip liberator plus with pas through 5pack when i travel it will allow all outlet to be use by extend the plug a few inch with it pas through feature a normal plug can be piggyback on top of the extender plug thereby double plug density for realom 6 plug to 12 plug for example although the total power consumption stoday i learnedl can not exceed 1680 watt it come in a pack of 5 and the average cost be 265 i consider this a small price to pay for more convenience and flexibility in summary i do recommend this amazonbasics charger because it work be wellmade and cost only 13 the price of apple part,Good

the design of the power plug do not allow it to fit snugly into the power socket i have it rock enough so that not enough power go to the drive it be stoday i learnedl on but not fully power it because a catastrophic loss of datum short the drive and the drive be render useless the power pack must be design to sit tightly into the power socket unless you do not care about your datum do not buy this with this power plug,Bad
the packing i receive the monitor in be fine but the monitor itself be terribly disappointing there seem to be a complete lack of qa of any sort the entire bottom edge have a dark shadow the exact opposite of backlight bleed there s one spot that s especially bad and very noticeable unfortunately the service network in india be atrocious the representative visit and check out the monitor confirm it be a manufacturing defect and submit the report but refuse to fix the problem instead they ask i to send it back to amazon this would make sense if i be in the usa but send it back internationally be a almost a expensive a the monitor itself amazon be not give i a prepaid shipping option and will put my credit card on the dock for both this monitor plus taxi and shipping plus international return shipping plus a new monitor plus taxi and shipping that ill need to replace this which i just can not afford the panel feel okay otherwise but it just do not come close in quality to the dell panel i ve see albeit the low resolution one not to mention that the price of the monitor drop immediately after i buy it that s just add insult to injury,Bad

i have not use it that long yet i m use it next to my 27 ultrasharp dell 144hz this monitor cost 12 a much a that one i want bigood gameer but it have to fit under cupboard fit be perfect size be much well than the 27 the ultrawide 34 be not tall enough so do not go that route color outstanding i m a retired studio owner and have a master eye for color this one replace a 24 nec multisync and a lacie 23 which i use for photo color not perfect i see some tearing in gaming expect i m only get 60fps with vsync expect i can move the game to my 144hz monitor and do if fps type but other game like astroneer i prefer in the large screen it be sharp not a sharp a the dell to be expect again a it dot pitch be low re same re on 27 and 32 hast to be low dpi on large screen i want curved but review on picture be so much high on this than the review on the curve offering i ideally i should have sell my dell and nec and spend the 160000 on the 144 curve gaming monitor to have it all gsync curve and high re stoday i learnedl for the money this be a wonderful monitor outstanding quality there be well but you ll need to pay 300 more most of my past monitor have be 150000 but since be retire i can not justify that price for casual use and game con oddly the color temp have 4 option slightly blue white and then the other 3 be way to warm white i be surprised it do not have kelvin adjustment to adjust per 100 rather than the 4 option which be about 1000k difference stoday i learnedl i pick the cool option and then tweak the color to warm up the white properly well package big box lot of cable most of which i do not need jerk the 24 nec out and have this monitor side by side with dell ultrasharp i do not recommend for it price it have horrible color saturation contrast view angle all poor pro very good color should be find for photo editing on a budget i do not miss that i do not get a curved 32 have speaker do i could clean up my desk area by pull out my speakerssubwoofer that be clutter up my area surely not the same sound quality but good sound for casual computer use i use vr and headphone for game,Good
the cable itself be sturdy good quality the cable be thick and good quality also have gold plate connector my only complaint be that the box that attach the connector for the phone be big so if you have a case for some phone it probably will not fit for example i have a lg g2 and now a g4 if i put a case on it the box that hold the connector be to big to get the connect the phone but work fine if you do not have a case if you notice the box that cover the connector on the original charger have a slim box hold it this one be thick so if you have a case it will not fit the only work around i find for this issue be buy a case that be make of rubber and then stretch it so it do work for the lg g2 and g4 but do not play nice with case i will post a pic you can see the end of the g2 same with the g4 be slim at the end in contrast to the amazon basic cable,Good
kingston 128 gb hyperx claim 350mbs read and 250kbs write speed on of video ie very large file over a usb 3031 port to that extent i would say that they be very much true to their promise a the attach image show the usb flash benchmark whose maker be in no way relate to kingston show an average of 245mbs for read and 190mbs for write operation on 16 mb file which be a i expect a little le than what kingston claim but it be actually within the ballpark it possible that it may run fast on fast or new computer for context sake i be run the benchmark on a 2 yr old laptop intelr coretm i53320 m cpu 260ghz 2601 mhz 2 core 4 logical processor with 8 gb of ram and first generation usb 30 port o be window 7 enterprise and it quite busy do a million other thing while the benchmark be run because i want to have a realistic scenario give the above i will say that i be quite satisfied with kingston claim of performance this thing be indeed live up to expectation for everything else i be pleased to note that everything else be clean i be able to quickly reformat the drive just in case and all be clean chkdsk show 122843392 kb total disk space 0 kb in 0 file 128 kb in 1 index 0 kb in bad sector 256 kb in use by the system 122843008 kb available on disk 131072 byte in each allocation unit 959714 total allocation unit on disk 959711 allocation unit available on disk a for look yes it do look cool and it do not exceed the size or weight of a normal usb drive there be a small lanyard that you can attach if you wish and a small sticker with the hyper logo on it more importantly the product be back by a 5 year warranty that consist of replace or refund defective unit with the full term spell out at hyperxgaming com slash wa to conclude i be pleased with hyperxs both performance and quality so it a 5star rating note the packaging clearly state that this hyperx be usb 31 gen 1 well clearly in the sense that they say so confusingly the industry decide to rename usb 30 a usb 31 gen 1 so what that mean be usb 30 i do not blame kingston for correctly claim usb 31 gen 1 compatibility but i do blame the industry for be a bit to cute here on the benchmarkkeep in mind that just because the output say that this flash drive can read or write at a 200mbs rate it do not meat that it will in real life have a ferrari not that i have one do not guarantee that my 80mile commute to work true will be do in half an hour because of road traffic weather condition and so forth same thing here there s a lot more than the flash drive involve into a data transfer so if this benchmarke 200mbs flash drive do no well than 30mbs in real life i would look at the bottleneck it could be the hdd the datum be come for realom or something else one thing that a benchmark such a this one provide be some assurance that it not the flash drive and it not computer usb 30 interface that slow down the process the benchmark result be below what kingston claim but like it always the case with a car mileage their testing be probably do under some very ideal very artificial condition while my benchmarking be on an old very busy computer so my result be low the second and third image show how hyperx look when compare to a perfectly decent usb 20 flash drive the second screenshot be a direct comparison the dot line be kingston the third benchmark the usb 20 device only for large file kingston be 10x fast for read and some 25x fast for write so this be a good one if what you care about be speed if you only care about storage a usb 20 flash drive should do,Good

the fbm01 case be pretty great for 25 it even cheap now of course it be anyway i modde the case a little and make it nonreturnable but it cheapness permit experimentation by cut outdrille some ventoday i learnedation in the for realont panel with a dremel tool and add a screen mesh to the for realont fan 120 mm pvc black pc cooler fan dust filter pack of 10 my only complaint with it be the pesky nonremovable hd holder you have to remove the motherboard if you want to access to the hds either that or remove the processor cooler which be way more trouble than it worth but what should i expect for 25 it definitely not a mini tower a it have a lot of more space than one of those what else cost a much a good dinner a half tank of gas etc this thing will outlive all of those and provide hour and hour of productive distraction just do not try to eat it,Good
these cable do not fit the fitbit charge hr properly the connector be too large the manufacturer cablor acknowledge this on a card that come with the cable i be include a photo of that card here be an excerpt for realom it grammatical error be theirs not mine if you use the original cable to charge your device for several time the charge port will be loose so cablor charge cable be design to be bigood gameer than the original to resolve the problem for the new device it will be a little tight just feel for realee to use it and insert the right side into the port and then press the left side hardly to make the usb charger cable in place this seem like a good way to break your charge hr and if you read some of the review many people have do just that if cablor really design these cable to be tight in charge hr that have have their charge port expand through heavy usage they should have say that in their product description find this out after purchase be simply unacceptable do not purchase these cable there be an actual fitbit brand cable available for a little more money i have now order that one i hope you find this review helpful on the other hand if you do not find this review helpful i d be interested in hear why so that i can attempt to edit it and make it more helpful to both you and other if you leave a comment on the review suggest how it would be more helpful i promise to respond to your comment and to attempt to incorporate your suggestion in my review if it be at all possible for i to do so my goal be to write review that help people a i have be help by the review other have write thank,Bad

first impression the product arrive in a small simple cardboard box there s definitely something to be say about slimmeddown packaging but an image of the product on the top face of the little box would go a long way towards give the product a more professional look that be say the bottom of the box be very informative and give a good snap shot of the product and it feature inside the box the hub and cable be both package in a small plastic bag pretty standard for these sort of product include under the component be a small information sheet the full text for realom the sheet be include below unpackaged and plasticfor realee the hub be a really nice combination of quality finish and material that be pleasing to the touch i be pleasantly surprised with a few thing right for realom the beginning the first of which be the actual weight of the hub it not exactly a heavy a i d have hope but it sufficiently weighty the silver finish be a pretty good match for apple product a well a a series of chromebooks and be thankfully a fingerprintfor realee finish another pleasant surprise be the rubber pad that cover the whole of the hub base i be half expect to have to add little rubber foot to make the hub stay put but the rubber pad seem tacky enough the include cable be 80 cm long or about 32 shielded and rather robust it utoday i learnedize a standard usb 30 male end to interact with your computer and a micro usb 30 male end for interact with the back of the hub at the time of write this the cable stoday i learnedl have not really give up it coil memory and stoday i learnedl tend to pull the hub around i m hopeful that it will continue to relax despite it thickness fit and finish before put the hub to use i poke and prod around at the varied port and material transition the brush aluminum surface the make up the face of the hub wrap around to the back and make up the trim around the circular component on either end see include picture the circular silver center have concentric ring give it a ribbed texture the rest of the body of the hub be a mattefinish white plastic and be equally pleasing to the touch the bottom have a grey rubber mat adhere to it that only add 68 mil of thickness or so the fit of the actual port within the surface be very nice all of the port be firmly in place and fit very well between the cutout of the silver finish nothing jiggle or move when you insert or remove usb or sd product i also appreciate that the usb port have the bright blue male end it a minor detail but many manufacturer be switch back to use plain black insert with the s super speed logo i prefer the pop of bright blue use the hub unsurprisingly be userfor realiendly and selfexplanatory it my opinion that the mark of a good usb product be easy plugandplay use there really should be no need for additional software setup time or anything that make use a regular usb port more convenient thankfully this hub come through in that respect plug it in and use it simple a that the hub require no windowsfuele installation and be instantly recognize by my computer in the same respect there be no apparent lag when plug in usb product to the hub file on flash drive be immediately accessible on the computer i do however have a few complaint about the design of the hub and cable while i think it might have originally be heavy enough to support whatever you plug into it the hub do seem to droop forward if you have it load down and brush past the protrude usb stick ideally i d love to have it permanently adhere to my desk to avoid any tipping make it easy to insert and remove thing not feasible for a portable product so it hardly a flaw the only other irksome quality be just with the length of the cable understandably the include cable at 24 be an appropriate length for use with laptop however a a desktop user i would prefer a long cable to well locate the hub on my desk perhaps not a big deal if you have a replacement cord or be willing to purchase one but it be something to consider if your desktop tower be not immediately adjacent to your tabledesk surface by the number obviously the most desirable feature of usb 30 be the approximate 10x speed compare to standard usb 20 that be say it would make for a poor product if the speed when transfer through the hub be diminish for my test i use a digital copy of the sean connery movie hunt for red october the file be exactly 20 gb make it an ideal large file for testing transfer rate see the number below for my comparison also include below be the information about the flash drive and computer i be use file transfer directly tofor realom the computer to computer 118 s to flash drive 176 s file transfer via the usb 30 hub to computer 135 s to flash drive 178 s a the number show the file transfer quick in both scenario to the computer fast than it do back to the flash drive and while the transfer via the hub be slightly slow than directly to the computer a few second be completely negligible for file this size the transfer of the average document or file stoday i learnedl happen almost instantaneously in both situation it should be note that the flash drive i use for these test be an extreme speed usb 30 flash drive that transfer at speed up to 245 mb a promise the computer use to conduct these test be an hp z1 workstation with an intel core i7 4790 360 ghz processor and 320 gb of ddr4 ram conclusion to conclude this hub be a nobrainer for someone look for a fast efficient solution for expand their available number of usb port although inherently obvious i feel the need to emphasize that a usb 30 hub will only garnish usb 30 speed when interface with a usb 30 port on your computer i ve see review for similar product that claim poor speed but there be no such thing a an upconverte usb hub anyway overall i m very satisfied with the build quality aesthetic and performance of the hub great product for a great value,Good

pro this be a nice little desktop humidifier it quiet enough not too bad looking put out a nice mist survive in storage for a year and with a correct fitting water bottle it do not spill when knock over i do keep it in a space empty of paperwork or electronic but i know if i do knock it over it will not damage anything i can even hold the bottle upside down briefly and it will be okay it also do not need refill every hour it will last a whole work day the mist it create be very fine and feel cool if you hold your hand over it water will condense so it be put out enough moisture to have an effect con if the filter be dry the humidifier take a little bit of time to get start but hold it upside down briefly do kickstart the process but the filter be not a long a a regular sized water bottle i find a half size water bottle work much well in that regard but even then the filter do not reach the bottom so there be water leave in the bottle even when the humidifier have run out you can put it in a cup of water so the filter touch the bottom but then there be the spillage issue also it be top heavy and will fall out of a lightweight cup it also do not have any ability to aim and you really need it to point directly at your face in order to get any benefit since it so small i use a stack of notepad a a makeshift prop so the whole bottle be at an angle then i get the moisture where i want,Good
it pretty cool come with all kind of little gadget it do not come with the game anymore not a deal breaker because i do not care about that but you can download it and have it if you want the picture be pretty cool not fuzzy clear sound be good the real test will be on the plane when we go away in a few month but i think it will work out nice it be very lightweight which mean part will most likely break easily i do not think this would be a good one for kid teen and adult who can be gentle,Good

office conferencing and phone collaboration have come a long way over the last two decade especially in term of performance convenience quality of sound and pricing gone be the day of halfduplex system where one party could speak but only oneway at a time like a walkietalkie that be the major problem with the oldfashioned speakerphone it be only a step up for realom a walkietalkie fullduplex speakerphone allow communication in both direction and unlike halfduplex allow this to happen simultaneously this jabra speak410 usb speakerphone take advantage of the late fullduplex communication technology use skype lync and other voip call and do a good job with each of they and it have a few other interesting twist a well for those who want the quick and dirty subjective point here they be pro excellent overall voice quality use skype and other voip service operates on window xp vista window 7 window 8x or mac o x compact about the size of a cd and about an inch thick very good audio control quite intuitive good monaural music speaker nice for background music professional contemporary design zipper protective case on the fence supplied minicd can have problem with some slotloading cdrom drive first impression setup remove the jabra speak410 for realom the display be easy if you just open it for realom the bottom a this be not a clamshell package the content be simple you ll find the speakerphone a stretchy zippered case a minicd an ikeastyle quick start manual the warranty and other notice and the first step in the manual be where i take issue have a minicd get stuck in a slot loading optical drive have be the topic of discussion on many computer forum and most notably those on the mac section of the apple support page the simple solution be to visit the jabra site and download the late driver and software that do mine show the following a of the date of this review jabra pc suite release 5302012 version 281972 jabra speak410 firmware release 6162012 version 110 once the software and driver be instal use my window 7 notebook it be a simple matter of plug into one of the usb port and operate the speakerphone note that this jabra speak410 be not happy with passive usb hub try this with my macbook pro and have to pull my passive hub and plug it in directly in use this jabra speak410 be quite easy to use look at it for realom the top down the mute button be locate at the 12 of the clock position and ring button for call be at the 6 of the clock position phone answer in green be at 7 of the clock and hang up in red be at 5 of the clock the volume be at 3 of the clock and the volume be at 9 of the clock power it on and you ll see a tiny white led at the bottom by the jabra logo a you increase the volume you ll see a series of tiny led work their way around the face of the unit and viceversa when you lower it at full volume all twelve led light up when you press the mute button all twelve of the led turn to red and remain that way untoday i learned you cancel the mute function which be a nice touch there s a standard 35 mm headset port for those that want to switch for realom a conference call to a private conversation which i test for all of about twelve second it work i test this with skype and the first thing that i see be a note jabraskypedriverexe want to use skype which i allow within the skype configuration i set my default to the jabra speak410 a default before i make my first of a few call without get too detailed about this the call clarity be excellent and the volume control be quite handy a be the mute button when i have to take a quick break the party that i converse with have no problem converse with i nor i with they a the clarity be excellent the internal microphone be omnidirectional and work quite well in a range of about three to six foot i be curious a to how this jabra speak410 would act a an external mono speaker for general music and video since it primarily a speakerphone do not expect much but end up be pleasantly surprised play a wide variety for realom classical to jazz instrumental to vocal and what be notable be that not only be there great clarity but even heavy bass hold up quite well it not a good a a dedicated set of good external speaker or a stereo system but for background monaural sound while work and wait for an incoming call this be quite good it worth note that recently i have to help a for realiend and client purchase and set up a polycom c100s speaker ip phone in an office where we have previously set up some dedicated polycom soundstation 2 unit just do a quick soundcheck comparison the jabra speak410 hold up quite favorably in term of sound quality and be probably more intuitive in actual use update 3122014 just a quick note to state that this jabra speak410 usb speakerphone do work with window 80 and 81 have test it with both and have encounter no issue at all summary though the speak410 be also optimize to work with microsoft lync service i do not have occasion to test it a i do not use it i have more to try with the mac but use this speakerphone with skype a my voip application it work quite well my only complaint be that jabra have choose to put their excellent software on a minicd and though it do not affect my installation a i choose to download the app and driver this could be a problem for some user for that reason i m knock off a half point for realom this review other than that the jabra speak410 be an excellent little portable speakerphone for the occasional conference call easily worthy of a solid 45star recommendation it a good conferencing solution for small or home office and it do not hurt that it work a a decent speaker for music a well jw 6112012 updated 3122014,Good

the product itself be very good and super bright it be probably too bright but there be way to block the edge a bit so that it do not distract the eye the problem i have be not with the light but with the hp r264dx laptop the 2 usb plug on one side be up for realont close to one body the other usb 30 plug be on the other side also up for realont close to one body so when you plug in the light and try to type your hand block the light and create a dark shadow so you can not see to type especially in the dark if the light fixture be twice a long it would fix that problem otherwise it be only useful to add some more light when there be light already which render it useless for i,Average
why i buy it i do not want to put an optical drive in to the computer i build for aesthetic purpose but there be thing i need to install onto my computer that could only be do through disc build quality the external drive be very slim and the surface do not scratch easily the edge show no sign of my fingerprint the bottom of the drive have small rubber foot that lift the device ever so slightly above the surface of the table the tray that will hold your disc come out for realom the for realont of the drive and it be access by a button also locate on the for realont the tray will not open unless it be power on which be put my mind at rest when i place it in a bag for portability use the drive be power by a single cord which be provide for you in the box you plug the cord into the back of the drive and plug the other end into a usb port and it will automatically turn on the only button on the entire device be a button on the for realont open the tray it drive quickly do whatever the job i need it to do and have yet to fail on i i have have no issue with it so far i have zero complaint,Good

new review a couple month ago i receive the original drive i talk about in the review below it die on i while onsite do timesensitive work and i ultimately decide to give adata another chance and get another ue700 flash drive in a direct replacement the new drive have be significantly well yes it be stoday i learnedl plastic i upload picture of the serial numberupc in case someone with an aluminum one can confirm that they re the same or not but it be 100 stoday i learnedl plastic it dye not paintedanodize and when scrape do not reveal the metal underlie the surface that all say while i baby the drive for some time worry it would lose file again i m begin to become more reliant on it it be pretty good so far the slider to expose the drive plug have break in a bit and become very smooth but not too much and it be just a fast a it be when i get it i ve only receive the format drive error once since i get the new one and i use it pretty for realequently so it not a bad drive knock on wood however that do not change the fact that the drive wasis sell with the price of a highend drive that would be commonly associate with high material cost ie metal usage i like the drive but if i know it be plastic ahead of time and be stoday i learnedl over 20 buck i would not have purchase it but yes it be slim and it have be fast i notice amazon update their page to remove the aluminum mention so i m happy if it stoday i learnedl suit your speed need and slim demand something hard to find in drive and you do not mind the price then have at it original review first thing i notice be instead of a nice aluminum housing i get plastic texture plastic sure but it be 100 black plastic and do not feel supremely durable either the slider click into position and it be very resistant to push out and in for realom the housing but it almost feel like it that way because the housing be just barely large enough in any case i be use it at work today first real use other than put my info on a txt file on it and the speed be fast 200 mb file transfer almost instantly on ssmarked usb port and my 2 gb software i be load go around 100 mb read it be nice and then it start get strange i religiously eject the drive properly but it start give i you must format this drive before you use it error i would try another pc just to make sure it be not that laptop but to no avail i have to reformat the drive 3 time and then it stop respond at all when you plug it in it do nothing no blink no connection nothing i m exceptionally disappointed in this drive right now and adata for make my work day hell go through some very backwards process to get the laptop i be work on load up i m debate get a direct replacement or just find another option i m perfectly okay with pay a premium for a flash drive the speed and quality be important to i but when i pay 510 buck more on a 16 gb drive that claim it have an aluminum casing and lifetime warranty only for it to die on the job and be make of plastic i can not help but want to avoid the brand entirely,Average

a mini projector be not a high end product we all know that it design to be portable and convenient and i think this projector nail it i work a a projectionist at a move theater for about a year and can be fain real lifey particular about image quality i buy this know it would not give i chill and i be pleased the focus be not extremely tight but a relatively sweet spot can be foundpro tip use text on the screen a a reference when you adjust the focus you can see blur on the edge very easily and know what to expect unfortunately even when you find say spot part of the screen will stoday i learnedl be out of focus if you re look for it however it only concern i when i m scrutinize the image not when i m simply use it that s when this thing really shineswhen you just use it i go to a weenieroast with some for realiend and throw it in my bag on a whim with a check this out i pull it out and immediately we lean up a truck she will for a screen throw out an extension cableive never really play with the battery read other review it seem like it will not make it through a movie so why bother grab some computer speaker and a tripod and have ourselves an outdoor movie the image quality be great at about 60full moon too and we have a blast also extremely worth note be that the roku do more than netflix of course there s amazon instant and hbo go and all that but even more noteworthy for i be plex i be absolutely thrilled to hear that this be an available channelfor those who do not know what plex be it a medium server and for those who do not know what that be it mean you can watch moviesor listen to music that be download on your computer over the internet in other word not only be the netflix library available to you wherever you have an internet connectionso be your own home digital medium collection comment i read in other review be mostly accurateit well with le ambient light small screen size give a sharp image the roku be extremely difficult to removethough i love that it can be such a for second computer screen use over hdirect messagei the speaker be not sufficient for more than 12 people etc one complaint i definitely have this device have a short battery life and to charge it back up you need an ac connectiona wall outlet i d like one or the other of those to be fixedif i could get through most moviesgood 3 hour charge or the battery could be charge by a usb connection that would make this thing really portable in my mind with a usb connection you could use essenthanks in advancelly anything that can charge a cell phone to charge the projector these other option would make it easy to charge on the road or outdoors i write this parthanks in advancelly to show it not just for kid i m a college student and have find some excellent use for this thing such a the outdoor movie second screen for my laptopwhich be extremely handy though the small computer text be quite a bit le sharp than a proper monitor watch episode of tv show in bed on the ceiling and more i purchase this to sort of see what i could do with it and i m not at all disappoint 6613 update i have decide to resolve the ac power only issue with a power inverter this will at least allow i to power the projector for realom a car i believe i can get a sufficient one for 2030 another very useful feature worth mention screen flipping be support you can orient the screen standard and flip both upside up and upside down i have not find a practical application for the flipped screenflippe a though the image be reflect in a mirror but i can use my magnetic foot gorillapod to hang the projector upside downfor realom the underside of a bunk bed roof of a car and use it that way the image be project upward so when it upside down it actually go down a way and be just about right just a couple more fun idea of way this little sucker can be use 121613 update the novelty having wear off i d be lie if i say this thing move for realom it place in my drawer much at all these day it probably do not help that i buy an external monitor for my computer and it too cold to use outside but i think it be worth mention in the review your use of it may dwindle too,Good

this be design for a standard usb port if your tablet use micro usb get a micro usb to usb cable i use this one micro usb to usb female cable usb otg for galaxy s2 i9100 this case be not securei would recommend modify it a i do below otherwise it your own fault if your tablet slip out i m type with the keyboard on my nexus 7 at a speed of 30 wpm instead of my usual 100wpmhey it beat use the touchscreen keyboard i literally just plug it in and it work great case fit the top prong be springloaded to adjust to any size however because there be no side prong it not secure at all ill have to modify it later in order to make the case portable construction quality a little sloppy but it do not look incredibly cheap i do not think there s much quality control regard stitching or where magnet be place or how wide apart the prong be size 55 x 9 x 175 inch it small but a little unnecessarily thick overall the main drawback of the case be it poor fit i do not trust three little prong with hold my tablet secure and unnecessary thickness quite a bit of extra space however these can be rectify with modification i like the convenient popout stand make your tablet feel like a laptop keyboard keyboard dimension 8 by 3 not include leather bezel so yes it be pretty cramp key size most essenthanks in advancel key be 15 cm but they re crowded i do not have an issue with letter so much a the punctuation key which be very crowded and only 1 cm wide key layout like i say letter and number key be lay out perfectly all other key be squeeze some be in a weird location like the apostrophe which be locate below the period i use apostrophe way more than the colon i feel like those should have be switch button functionality i notice some key do not work this may or may not be a function of the tablet not the keyboard my delete key do not work overall they do a good job keep the alphanumeric key the same size but i would have appreciate a more intelligent design accord to what key be use most shift ctrl apostrophe etc the really cramp key be at the bottom so type word be not the hard part it end they that slow you down i like that it have signal for capslock numlock etc for the price i have no complaint can this compare to a fullsized keyboard no be it much more efficient than any touchscreen keyboard yes tip it fast for i to type with my hand above the keyboard like how you d play key on a piano rather than with your palm flat down if you have large hand you ll definitely have a hard time if you plan on carry your tablet around with this i would strongly recommend the follow purchase a tpu or hard case you can find tpu case for like 5 buck remove the metal prong superglue on the tpuhard case to the keyboard case adjust the thickness of the case by bend the spine this will really reduce the bulk see the modify case picture i post in the product gallery not beautiful but it work now i can use this case without worry that my tablet will slip out and crack on the ground not to mention remove the prong and bend the spine make it so much thin,Good

there seem to be some confusion about the performance of these drive stem for realom the benchmark people be post in review for the 32 gb version of the drive the realworld performance use the default file system fat32 the default window policy quick removal and transfer large file be around 20mbs write and 150mbs read for the 128 gb model the write speed increase to 30mbs with read speed remain unchanged transferring lot of small file at once will be slow than transfer large one you re not go to get symmetrical 100mbs readwrite speed at this price point when it come to write datum these drive will have a small cache that s far quick than the rest of the available storage any advertised write speed may be refer to that cache if you write a small enough amount of datum to the drive it will be write to that cache at a high speed then in the background that datum will be trickle out of the cache and into the slow part of the drive however when write large quantity of datum the cache will be saturate at which point the write speed will drop to that of the regular tlc memory it exactly the same for their lowmid range ssd the 840 evo be advertise a have 500mbs sequenthanks in advancel write speed and crystaldiskmark will appear to back this up but that s because it not test any deeply than the slc turbowrite cache if you run a sustained sequenthanks in advancel write operation on the 840 evo it ll be force to write directly to the regular tlc nand you will see the speed plummet to 150mbs after about 3 gb of datum have be write and it will remain at that speed untoday i learned you stop write to get sustained sequenthanks in advancel write performance at 400mbs you would need have to have buy the 840 pro which use fast mlc nand for the entire storage area make sure you look carefully at the benchmark people be post one of the review here be show the 32 gb modelpackaging but the crystaldiskmark result be for a 128 gb device also pay close attention to the benchmark software version and setting for example new version of crystaldiskmark be run a different set of test to old version so the result be not necessarily go to look the same even if the device be perform identically the default test size set for crystaldiskmark be 1gib but people be post result take with that set to 100mib this will make all the difference between get a 20mbs write result and a 100mbs write result presumably because 100mib be not big enough to saturate the abovementione cache i ve provide crystaldiskmark result for realom two different version of the program and with different setting to illustrate all this anyway i have four of these drive i have not have they long enough to comment on longevity but so far so good they get quite warm but i have not see any overheatingthermal throttling i pull the entire 128 gb of datum off one drive and it be read at the same 150mbs the entire time the shape of the drive be slightly inconvenient because it can cover a neighboring port if the port be stack closely together eg motherboard io cluster,Good
i get the 30 mm f14 art and while the focus seem okay at first it be clear after a couple of outing my keeper rate be pretty low when it be in focus it be sharp it just be usually a bit blurry after some research my option be either to send the lens in to sigma some folk say they need your camera too or get this thing even though the focus issue be cover by warranty you stoday i learnedl have to pay for insured shipping each way with that in mind the dock seem a little le unreasonable in price besides i like tinker with thing it take i about an hour and a half of work to dial in the right value though an hour of that be pretty ineffective the thing be they just give you the dock and you download the software and there be no official recommend way to come up with the adjustment value i recommend browse around for focus calibration tutorial what end up work the good for i be to be in a bright room at relatively high but not too grainy iso and have a tape measure lean against a wall at an angle then i focus in at the 1 ft marker at various distance after several iteration of trial and error i be happy with the focus at all the adjustable distance i end up with 1 10 8 9 for realom close to furth there be specialized device which have a ruler at an angle and something to aim at and can even be mount to tripod but they be pretty expensive for what they do what would bring this dock up to a 5 star must have be if sigma throw in a focus calibration device to accompany it and a guide on how they recommend you do it a video on the website at least there be other comment about the choice of adjustable distance in this case 3 m 4 m 6 m and infinity but that be how lens focus work if you look at the range finder those distance be space equally apart it seem weird but give you the good coverage for the entire lens range,Good

i generally place a lot of stock in the customer review a for the most part i have find the majority of the rating to be accurate indicator of product quality accordingly i purchase the logitech s150 usb power speaker base on relatively strong review the first pair that i receive rattle terribly and i think that i just get a bad pair and order a second set the second set be slightly well than the first but the right control speaker to both set rattle sometimes excessively the speaker will play adequately at low volume but if turn up to even a moderate level to overcome normal background noise the right speaker will rattle at least two for two for i my recommendation be to purchase a different speaker however there be some positive aspect to these speaker they be attractive small and the sound quality be not too bad if the right speaker do not rattle the s150 usb speaker would certainly rate at least a 4 base on the price update fix the source of the rattle be the three control button at the base of the speaker to eliminate the rattle place a piece of 3 m magic tape over the buttonscut slightly large than the width and length of the button just make sure there be enough tape to keep the button for realom vibrate in the speaker housing the tape be elastic and permit the button to function and if do carefully do not detract for realom the speaker appearance the sound be now quite goodeven at loud volume,Bad

when practical combine certain portable product into one compact unit just make sense for instance instead of carry a separate portable battery and router the hootoo tripmate titan httm05 combine those function into a single unit while also function a a networkattache storage na server it really an impressive featureset especially for a device that measure just 374 inch 95 mm high and 173 inch 44 mm long and weigh a little over half a pound about 93 ounce the tripmate titan have a 10400mah power bank which be good for not only run the device itself for potenthanks in advancelly ten of hour but can also charge demand usbpowered device like large smartphone and tablet multiple time through it 5v21a usb port a for charge this battery in the tripmate titan the device have a standard microusb port 5v16a so if the include cable be not handy it should be no issue grab one that be a for the router functionality there s a lot to it in access point ap mode you can plug a standard network cable into the rj45 ethernet port and then provide wireless access 80211bgn 24ghz for any combination of five wifienable device this be great for hotel room where only a single network cable be provide of course there s also bridge mode for similar situation where you want to share the connection and only a limited number of device usually one or two per room use our hotel example be allow onto a protect wifi network finally in router mode you can connect the tripmate titan to a cable or dsl modem and use it like a regular wireless router na functionality let you hook up one usb flash or hard drive fat 1632 and ntfs 4 tb maximum directly to the device or a many a four if you use a separate usb hub up to five device can then simultaneously access any connected usb storage device make medium sharing and stream a breeze in fact if a hub be use you can also transfer file between any of the attach drive with the same hootoo tripmate plus window macintosh io or android app you use for setup all find on the website where you can also easily update the firmware and get an extended manual in addition to stream medium for realom connected usb storage the tripmate titan allow device like the chromecast roku or other dlnaenabled device to work on the most authenticationheavy network again like those find in hotel so your option onthego be extensive on the top of the device be a power button where a short press of one second activate the battery lead indicator and a long press of three second activate the internetlan four led and a wifi lead for the four led one led indicate 0 25 of the battery be leave two led indicate 26 50 three led indicate 51 75 and all four led indicate 76 100 for the wifi led flash blue indicate the system be load solid blue indicate system load flash green indicate connect to the internet and solid green indicate internet connect press the reset button next to the lan port for 10 second reset the tripmate titan a you can see it a high function highly portable device the build quality warranty and support be also excellent my only criticism be that i m not a fan of the rubber flap that cover the port on the upper part of the unit since they do not always stay in place easily that s admittedly a minor criticism however and one not relate to how well the device itself work thank to hootoo for the review unit,Good

so why i get this the typical use case be regard people that want to transfer photo to a pc or watch movie so the complain be that you can not watch protect movie aka movie that you buy directly for realom the flash drive that s not an issue for i because what i want to do be to move document for realom my ipad to a pc currently i be present quite often at conference and i be travel your with my ipad fast security check le weight etc the issue be that i be edit my presentation untoday i learned the very last moment so i need a reliable way to copy those presentation to the computer that we be go to use to present nope most of the time people collapse when you want to connect your ipad to the projector so basically it mandatory to use their computer so my problem be to copy those file for realom the ipad to a computer cloud storage i find that neither icloud nor onedrive be reliable for this too many compatibility issue dropbox be fine but with the 2 step authentication people will watch you enter password for more than one minute and they will also start comment on the other file that you have there ie sale proposal for your competitordoc in that way i think that this implementation be fast and simple enough lexar app for io be not great but not necessarily bad than other that i test i like the dropbox implementation although i can not copy file for realom dropbox to the flash drive use the lexar app 1 star what i could do be to use dropbox app to export the file to open in second row on the export option of io and then put in the lexar app to later copy it to the flash drive not ideal because you have to open the file first but it well than nothing speed well speed be decent enough not the fast flash drive ever but will get the job do besides the bottle neck be not use it on a pc be use it on io to sum up in an non ideal word where apple limit what can be do by third party on io lexars implementation be decent enough to solve my problem be the ideal solution no but the level of integration with io that would make i happy depend on apple not lexar 1 hour update i manage to copy a file for realom dropbox to the flash drive use the lexar app 1 star also i forget to mention that the cable be pretty thick and the jumpdrive be metallic aluminium maybe so it feel solid and expensive week 1 update if your be go to format the drive be sure to keep it a master boot record otherwise you will not be able to access it on io week 2 update the micro sd card can be replace it locate in the usb connector a little bit tricky to pull out but it a great thing that the memory can be expand in a near future,Good

i m write this review 30 minute after complete set up of this router and update it to the late firmware auto update to 114167984 because i m so disappointed i pick this router up for realom target a a closeout item for 200 i figure it would be a step up for realom the cheap wd ac router i have be use a range be exceedingly poor with the wd i finally get the thing set up update and lo and behold it do not support a feature that i assume all modern router do an encrypt guest network i use the guest functionality to isolate device on my network into moreless secure zone since user on guest network can not see each other and i m terribly disappointed to find that this router force guest user into a captive portal page every time they connect nowhere in the specification do it state this maybe this be something useful for a small business such a a cafe but it not particularly useful for home use a it mean that client have to authenticate with a browser every time they connect to the network annoy to do repeatedly with smartphone this be cover in a review of a different linksys router the ea6200 in june so i do not expect the situation to change httpwwwcomputerworldcomarticle2940566networkinglinksyssmartwifimakesastupidguestnetworkhtml i have to agree strongly with this too long did not read snippet of the article which i feel applie to this unit a well ignore this pretty big issue the option to release and renew wan dhcp be find in the troubleshooting and diagnostics section of the admin page and there be no tool or connection information on the internet setting page even on the diagnostic page there be few detail about the connection want to find the assign dns server ip for troubleshoot good luck find they hint they be not there not exactly what i expect for what might be consider a highend consumer router one interesting observation upon turn on the router and change the password before plug it into the internet the router do not automatically get a dhcp address this require a restart have to figure out what to do with this thing now hope to be able to sell it for what i buy it for since there s no ddwrt support yet it quite disappointing that this do not offer the feature my r7000 at a different location do despite have more modern hardware,Average

i buy this cool pad for my hp pavilion dv7 laptop a promise it provide a cool surface for my laptop to sit on and improve the airflow now my laptop only get mildly warm which be a big improvement many reviewer have complain that their laptop slide off after prop up the adjustable foot my solution be to cut a narrow strip of grip shelf liner and place it under the back of the laptop it do not interfere with the airflow and keep my laptop in a stable position personally i find the blue light to be annoying at night which streak across my desk and wall the fan occasionally make strange noise a well update after about 5 month of use it stop work bummer however i stoday i learnedl use it to keep my laptop elevate since it the perfect height for i to type comfortably and prevent the cool vent for realom be block,Good
this product be amazing consider how inexpensive it be many time when you get something on the lowend pricewise you get something that function but be not really usable not so with this although there be lot of thing that could be well in a more expensive unit this product make the sacrifice in the right place so you end up with something that do it job really well sure the little stand be flimsy and the image quality be good but not perfect it do not have a zoom capability you adjust your mag by control the distance to the target but all those thing be not really much of a problem view the image and judge for yourself pro adjustable illumination work very well focus control be smooth with just the right amount of drag image quality be impressive give the low price of the unit the little stand work very well again consider the price do not require you to download driver and software although you can amazing magnification that actually work con nonremovable clear plastic shield get in the way if what you be view be not flat depth of field very shallow i use picasa 3 on window 7 and do not download any driver or software you choose the magnification by adjust the distance between your target and the end of the microscope then you adjust focus to get the maximum magnification the target surface must be very close to even with the clear plastic shield at this point you can focus it in a before but then if you want the maximum 250x magnification you just keep turn the focus counterclockwise and eventually it sharpen again but at much high mag it be difficult to use because the depthoffield be very very narrow meaning that you can not get the whole image into focus if you be look at something that be not flat also at this magnification it be quite difficult to focus because touch it move the camera around so much but with a little patience you can get pretty good result the plastic shield be a problem for view thing like circuit board at 250x mag i could not get the part i want to see close enough because stuff on the board would make contact with the shield it be not removable probably because without it get the microscope at the correct distance would be difficult and for realustrating however i think i will use a dremel tool to remove mine,Good

this head unit give you a much functionality a you would want in a head unit at an extreme budget price a with any bargain shopping there will be aspect that have be cost cut on the product somewhere here be the drawback that come with the low price 1 menu option very little simply you have different source to switch between of course basstreblebalancefade and a loudnesseqcolor option that be it very austere and actually it make use this headunit very easy and without read the instruction really 2 low amp output 60w x 4 for the non cd player unit because of this the volume have to stay near max volume to be hear with the window down you will absolutely have to run this at max most likely this would not be bad necessarily except that at high volume you get a persistent and audible power whine and white noise note the latter occur in my car that have the stock speaker for realom 1997 speaker that do not require much amplification 3 dearth of navigation option for sd card there be no navigation with the sd card instead you have simply a forward and backward through track this being say the most important drawback for realom the above be the low amp output which limit audio quality quite for realankly the latter be one of the reason why you change out your headunit for an aftermarket one and this one do not meet the usual standard now that be out of the way let get to the feature there be a few color to choose for realom on this unit and by default shuffle through they all the dark color be hard to read in the daylight so i select white a always on which can be read in daylight fain real lifey well cyan be another close second in general not a bad look color a it outline the shape of the unit and illuminate the constituent button functionality with this unit be really all you could want bluetooth minisd usb incharge aux in and radio there be no cd player on the noncd unit that be bluetooth be a easy a change the src button to bt and then find it on my phone and connect take 5 second and have no problem during playback pandora iphone there be 0 dropout sd card do not play flac do not expect this anyway and will play mp3 and aac a note above you can only navigate by track on the sd card and not by sub menu the latter be unfortunate and make track select quite tedious note the song name appear and scroll across the screen quickly so you can tell which one you select aside for realom this all other function operate a they should radio play there be 6 preset button to use and a big knob to adjust the volume with one disappointment with this unit be the fact that even though this be double din it stoday i learnedl only use 1 line of led text what s the point of have a double din if you be not go to use the space honestly you be get close to what you pay for here low audio quality by way of a weak internal amp thus have to jack up the volume in order to hear the music and the bare minimum for extra feature what can not be argue be that you be get all accessibilitiy with current technology in bluetooth usb sd card and aux if you need to convert your car quick and inexpensive to mesh well with current device and usually listen to your music at low volume and without the window down you be get a lot of functionality for the price,Average
i think how it could be wrong a the technology be there for long i be wrong within minute find two key f7 and tab will not pop back once push piece of junk while try my returning find the usb receiver stick inside my computer take i a while to take it out how bad it could be even my for realee gift usb mouse be strong than it do not buy where i can upload picture,Bad
samsung write transfer speed up to 130 mb be mislead buyer 130 mb be read speed not write speed it writing speed be 33 mb average not a fast a pny 128 gb turbo flash drive but samsung read speed be fast than pny therefore i takeoff a star for mislead product description i stoday i learnedl keep it because i need a small flash drive that all i do the speed test and time stop to compare the two flash drive let you guy see in the picture attachment,Good
i order 2 of these one work the other fail after a day right after i throw the packaging away a 50 fail rate be too high for a good review i hope the other one last long photo be of result of drive test utoday i learnedity include with software i include it to save time for anyone who might be spend a couple of hour try to figure out what they be do wrong check this first update i have the defective drive replace the new one workedfine with window 7 i recently update to window 10 and find out it do not support window 10 i hope they re work on it,Bad
this be a normal look flash drive with the port that go in and out this mechanism keep the usb cover when not in use and the plastic casing will protect it well the open bottom be expose unlike some flash drive with cap but you will not have to worry about lose the cap ever the unit i have be 32 gb and you can also grab 64 gb if need i have to admit that this be not the most stylish but the matte plastic finish keep it clean for realom fingerprint and serve it purpose well in your usb 30 port the flash drive itself do not look too boring with it matte plastic finish it get diamond shape cut in the for realont but it might feel a bit cheap to some of you due to how light it be the casing be completely black but a red light blink when readingwrite and it not annoyingly bright at all in term of speed i find this unit to be fast than what they advertise while both read and write speed seem to drop over some time the inithanks in advancel test give i 270 mb read 123 mb write and drop over time i m not sure if ill trust the casing to hold up if a car run over the flash drive but it ll transfer and keep your datum well at a fast speed there s also a keyring hole that you can attach on a keychain or a lanyard and your datum will be safe and sound for an ordinary user who s afor realaid of lose tiny flash drive i d recommend this but if you re someone who drop thing all the time other flash drive with high build quality like silicon power jewel j80 might be well pro fast readwrite you probably will not and can not lose this con build out of plastic check out the full review on normal consumer thanks for read,Good
i just receive mine today and be sadly disappoint i soooo want to keep this cute lil stitch but i m not sure if mine be a defect the one i receive only could hold 29 gb and not the 32 gb a advertise would have love to keep this but i sadly have to return this i understand that you do not get the full 32 gb but 29 gb be a lot to be miss the head be not flush to it body like how it be in the photo on amazon for some reason the one i receive have a little gap in between the head and the body add a couple photo of the stitch i receive the one i receive be actually a dark blue in color because of the flash on my camera it not a dark blue like in the photo on amazon,Bad
let i point out that all of my testing be do on an android phone and i only use bluetooth perhaps thing might work differently be you set yours up differently or be use a different type of phone but for i i want it to work exclusively on bluetooth and i need to have it work on my android phone if you just want to use this for listen to music it be great i first test this by pair it and then make sure the fm station on my car be the same a the one i have set on the device the music for realom my phone sound good with the bluetooth pair and i do not have any issue you just have to adjust the volume on your stereo and on your phoneor on this device the sound be rich and i could crank it up loud enough so i could hear the music great i also test the charge port and they seem to be able to charge my phone without a problem but the main thing i want to use this for be hand for realee bluetooth call and it do not work right for i to test this i call my work voicemail several time my welcome message on my voicemail play great through the speaker of my car just like the music do i then record my voicemail that be several sentence long just a a test and i hang up i think everything work great but then i go in and listen to the voicemail that be record and it cut in and out so much that i could not hear the voicemail at all i could only hear a for realaction of a word or two out of the several sentence that i record i figure that must be a fluke so i try reboot my phone and unplug the device and try it again second time same result it be impossible to properly hear the audio that be generate for realom this device i give this two star because if all you want to do be listen to music via bluetooth in an old car that do not have bluetooth or if you want to charge your phone it work great but the main thing i want to use it for be bluetooth hand for realee call in my car that have no bluetooth capability that however be a big bummer a it do not work without cut out terribly perhaps i get a bad device with a bad microphone so maybe you will get lucky all i know be my unit do not work properly at least not with my phone luckily i get this unit for realee in exchange for a fair and honest review so i do not spend any money on this but if you be think about buy this i d recommend wait untoday i learned more review come in to see if other people be experience the same problem i do i m bum out i really want this one to work if only the microphone work properly it would have be the perfect device edit 11615 the company send i a replacement unit but it do the same thing i do finally realize though that i could get the microphone to pickup my voice if i move my head about 2 inch for realom the unit then it would pick up my voice just fine on the phone call but a soon a i move back to sit in my car seat normally it can not pickup my voice of course i can not drive with my head two inch for realom this unit a i could not see the road so this unit simply do not work properly for hand for realee call but do play music great i m not sure why other people claim it work unless they do not test all of the feature and perhaps do not actually try to talk to someone with the device hand for realee through bluetooth two unit definitely have microphone problem it just do not pick up sound properly,Bad
all the kit arrive for my beastofabuild and so i clear the table and set about put it all together but when i come to install the samsung 960 pro 1 tb pcie never minde m2 stick it all go south asus provide a removable standoff to suit the length of the m2 card so it be a twopiece design the standoff come out to select the length and the retain screw that sit on top of that secure the card when i attempt to remove the retain screw the standoff come out which be all well and good however the retain screw have be so tightly secure into the standoff that there be simply no way to remove it i put it in a secure socket and find a perfectfit cross screwdriver i try gently and firmly at first but eventually have to ramp it up to brute force and naturally strip the cross game over dismal failure 650 mainboard with one little standoff prevent i for realom complete the build will have to take it to a machine shop to try and have it carefully drill out waste of time and energy fail edit googling to try and find a replacement part reveal that overtightene standoffscrew be a commonproblem with asus mainboards many people express their for realustartion at asus lack of support on this and it seem near impossible to get a replacement,Bad
i m finally replace my 32 gb patriot tab and there s only one drive ill do it witha big patriot tab for four solid year this durable usb drive have dangle on my keychain every day it be drop it be dunk in water it be leave on my car dashboard in triple digit heat and it once spend two day lose in the snow but it always work flawlessly a a mobile computer programmer with multiple workstation i use this drive to carry my current project between system and it be through thousand of plugunplug cycle and hundred of thousand of readwrite cycle without error the metal be wear and the case be slightly bent for realom a for realeak sledgehammer accident but it stoday i learnedl work a well a the day i buy it the drive format to a capacity of 288 gb and it have never lose or corrupt a file it do tend to get a little hot when perform large file transfer but i ve always chalk that up to the limited heat radiating capacity of the metal she will every computer i ve plug it into have read the drive without issue and file transfer be reasonably fast for a usb 3 drive i highly recommend this drive i m only replace mine because i need more than 32 gb time for a 128 gb upgrade,Good

i m a newegg eggxpert reviewer and also pc power user so have review my share of router pc component over the last 10 year i have to start by say that i absolutely love asus motherboard and graphic card that go for almost all of their product their design and build quality be world class and be top among lead manufacturer for realom my experience for this review i also buy the netgear nighthawk x6 ac3200 triband wifi router r8000 to compare design feature software connection speed signal strength and overall signal stability below the result of my comparison design shape and form both the netgear and asus be place flat on the table have a fain real lifey large footprint compare to previous dual band router both have six external antenna that can be fold the asus antenna screw in and tend to unscrew itself a you move the direction of the antenna the netgear antenna be fix and fold neatly flat on top of the router both be pitch black all around would have like to see some color on they to be honest both router have dual core processor that allow multitaske both have a row of white led that light up to indicate power on ethernet port connect internet access etc both be wall mountable which be a plus if you want to save desktop space the netgear however show the text under each lead upside down if you want to mount it on the netgear the description under each led be write ie internet power etc whereas in the case of the asus it have an icon which be very small and hard to make out which be which on the for realont of the asus leave be two button one to disable the led light if it bother you at night it be not a bright a the netgear i have to say asus also have a wifi onoff button on the right for realont the asus have the usb port the netgears lead on of switch sit at the back together with the usb port the wps and wifi onoff on the netgear sit on top of the router the wps button sit at the back of the asus both device power onoff switch and reset button sit at the back both router have four ethernet port in the back to hardwire internet device all in all i prefer the netgear design a far a shape form and where button be place this be a personal preference the only noticeable drawback on the asus be the antenna that tend to lose itself if you change the angle of the antenna whereas the netgears antenna be fix to the body of the router and fold flat feature and function both have the two 5ghz and one 24 ghz channel make it part of the late generation of triband ac wireless router go into each router functionality line by line compare it will make this a very long review so in short they both have a slew of function that will allow you to customize your network set up guest access change the router to an access point or set a bridge etc etc software both have web base interface that will allow you to configure your device set security protocol and monitor traffic and connect device that say the asus gui be way more advanced in look feel and functionality remind i of the asus motherboard uefi graphical user interface gui this be where asus knock the ball out of the park it be so much easy navigate use the asus interface well lay out and the overall interface experience be much well than any other router manufacturer include netgear dlink and linksys the asus router also have an intelligent triband smart connect automatically select the fast band for all device individually base on demand and capability however this be where i think asus need some work and hopefully with future optimization and update it will address the stability and inconsistent connection i experience use the function signal strength and stability both router have very strong and consistent speed when connect use ethernet connection the big difference be in wifi connection this be where the asus device fail behind in fact it fail to deliver compare to the netgear the asus use the smart connect combine all three wifi network band into one the device supposedly then decide what for realequency work well with your laptop ipad cell phone or streaming device the reach and consistency of speed when connect to the netgear be far more superior the asus tend to not only give you inconsistent speed far away for realom the router but it for realequently disconnect and reconnect i suspect it be a a result of immature ai build into the smart connect function a the device switch for realom 5ghz to 24 ghz a most know 24ghz give you le bandwidth but well range whereas the 5 ghz give you superior bandwidth but short range that be why streaming be well over 5ghz band unfortunately for asus this be a deal breaker a there be nothing that annoy my wife and i more be a poor connection and bad for realequent disconnecting when stream pandora or movie over roku in summary sadly the asus fail at the most important test which be signal stability for realequent disconnect can not be tolerate nor should it be expect for realom a 300 high end router it remind i a high end graphic card with an immature bio it do not sit well with the tech geek,Average
apple mfi certified poweradd 8pin lightning to usb cable 66 ft 2 m charge and sync cable cord for iphone 6 6 plus 5 5c 5 ipad pro air mini 4th gen ipod touch nano white this charger be okay but i m not completely happy with it although it work and be more convenient because of it length it also have it drawback a it keep pop out of my iphone 6 plus it do this because the tip be too big attached be a picture of a typical iphone charger and this charger it ll work if you have no case on your phone but buyer beware if you have a case,Average
the usb arrive fast and i move my file for realom my computer to the usb very easily the transfer rate be super fast however the reason my review be only 1 star be because i ve have this usb for just over 30 day and the swivel break i can not return the usb because it be over 30 day if not for this i would rate this usb with 5 star,Bad
this be such a genius idea but execute extremely poorly apple bad design flaw in the iphone 5 to i anyway have be the lousy charge port location i ve go through cable after cable a a result of use my phone while rest it against myself or a surface awful so i be quite excited when i see belkin a longtime goto for cable and charger have produce what should have be one of the good design to overcome the apple for realustration however i have not even have this cord for 2 12 week and it have already split i point out two fault a the elbow do not taper into the cable but end abruptly into a b incredibly flimsy excuse for a cord i have expect so much more and so much well for realom belkin really disappoint,Bad

this review be for the ezopower 6a 30w 3in1 multi function 4 port usb 20 hub desktop charger station with otg support white first i want to purchase this product to 1 expand my usb port for my laptop and 2 a stand for my phone while it charge this product be without prime service but i see now it join the prime service which i probably would not purchase this product without it the shipping take about 34 day again this be without prime the package arrive safe and without damage the package be pack well and no visible damage to the packaging or the product when i take the station out of the box it be very light weight and i feel it probablyy would not hold up well against a hard drop to the ground on the other hand i also do not see the likelihood of drop it once i hook it up to my laptop my review be base on the follow 3 area 1 installation 2 charge speed and 3 usb port the station come with two cord one usb cable and a power cord after read the user manual i find out that you can use the chargingusb port station 3 different way one you can use it solely for charge by just plug in the power cord you have one port red for smart charging and 3 usb port for other charger adapter such a apple samsungetc second you can use it for usb port only by just plug in the usb cord to a laptop or computer for this purpose you can use all four port a usb port then third you can plug in both usb cable and power cord the smart charge red would solely for smart charging and not a an usb port the other three port can act both for charge and usb port the installation process be pretty painless you plug it in and it instal a few minute later the station be good to go i have an iphone 6 plus which fit on the charge station both stand up and side way pretty well one thing i be hope when i order the station be that i would be able to charge my phone with it sit up unfortunately that this be not possible there be an on and off button on the station where if it on there be a tiny blue light would come on i find this function a bit pointless i would like most of the people would want to keep the station on all the time i use a ipad charger to charge my iphone 6 plus i do not find the power charger on the station be a good a the ipad charger therefore i probably would not be use the station to charge my phone i test the usb port two different way with the power adapter and without the power adapter without the power adapter the usb port work very well plug in and play with no probably transfer datum around on the other hand with the power adapter in the performance be just not quite the same there be noticeable lag with the plug in and play the data transfer speed be not a smooth overall i find this product to work well but could be well if i be just look to expand my usb port i would recommend this product but a a combination of charger and usb station i find the product would not work a well full disclosure i receive this item at discount in exchange for my honest review,Average
i like this case mainly because it simple and perfect for light build i m not sure why people complain about the cable managment so much because it actualy easy to run the wiring behind the upper hdd holder and hide the main power cable almost entirely the rest can simply be bundle up and tie to the few hook on the side of the case look very neat in the end the stock fan be quiet and move plenty of air and the hard drive mount at the bottom be great it absorb all vibration for realom the hdd makig it very quiet it come with cable tie and more screw than you even need it pretty sturdy and feel well make for a budget case this one be great,Good

i ve have a belkin cable in white for over a year and decide to order a pink one a we be go to travel and i need a back up well well wellplugge it in all work great phone chargeduntoday i learned i decide to pull it outthe tip break up and get stick in the phone luckily pretty loosely and i be able to pull it out without damage my phone all of this on day one i just receive this cable today and that be the first time use it i m not sure if i get the one bad product out of hundred of thousand or if their overall quality go downi just know that the money be waste and i would not recommend this cable to anyone,Bad

mini be definitely relative in this case i will be post photo of the unit next to a soda can an iphone it work a describe when my husband i travel together we often have two laptop two cell phone two ipod sometimes find outlet for everything can be a pita this be helpful i ve have an iphone an ipod charge on the usb port a netbook kodak zi8 pocket cam charge on the for realont port contrary to what some review claim you can indeed use both usb port at the same time perhaps the reviewer be experience slow trickle charging use the usb port for thing like laptop such nothing new in the charge world but if you use the for realont outlet for item that need a lot of juice the usb port for thing like cell phone camera mp3 player etc you may be fine i certainly have not have a problem another key feature in my opinion be you can change the orientation of the plug so it can go up down right or leave see my photo i even use this at home quite often anyway i highly recommend this unit if you find yourself regularly hunt down power outlet p after publish this review i buy a second one at under 11 this product be a great deal ill be able to keep one in my laptop bag use another in my home office,Good
i buy a couple of these for an embed installation of a storage platform pretty much the o need to live on this device and the drive bay be export for my na the drive be in fact tiny but on my laptop the metal part do visibly stick out a little bit maybe 18 of an inch compare to a standardsize flash drive it be fain real lifey inconspicuous and might be mistake for a port cover the lanyard hole be unnecessary for this environment so i will probably chopsand it off before put it into the system performance be passable and probably good enough for an o boot think knoppix for realeenas openfiler active boot disk etc with attos benchmark tool on direct io with overlap io i see write speed approach 93mbytessec and read speed approach 181mbytessec when the transfer size reach 128 kb performance peak and remain steady through the 8 mb size that i stop my benchmark at in summary the main reason to pick this drive be not blaze performance or invisibility or ability to leap capital e in a single bound if you need 2 gb or 4 gb also available that do not protrude too much for realom your usb port it a viable option,Average

this be more than just an alarm clock it be also a great bluetooth speaker a well i love this clock it just work it be a nice touch that it also come with a aux cable the dimmer function work great if you need a blackout when try to fall asleep when i sleep i dim the clock all the way down and turn off the led and it be amazing how dark it get the fm reception be very good just make sure the top of the antenna be position a high a possible i like that you could program 2 separate alarm and that you could choose multiple alarm ringtone and also set it to use a certain light mode for the led when the alarm go off they though about everything when they design this i would recommend this to anyone look for a modern alarm clock that look beautiful,Good
it be put together with copper foil inside and probably cost 50 cent to produce 10 down the toilet,Bad
i have my fair share of bluetooth speaker to compare this to and this may very well have put itself tie for first place the only feature the other have be it water resistant but this one have a feature or 2 that i like well than the other i love the ease of connect onoff switch be something i prefer over the power button that you have to press to turn on and press and hold to pair this one be easily pair to bluetooth and when i plug in the aux cord it automatically connect once i unplug the aux it automatically switch to bluetooth again it can also be a power bank that will charge most smart phone to full or almost fully charge use the usb port slot on the top i have high capacity battery charger so i would rather not drain the power of this to charge my phone but i guess for some people it be convenient to have an all in one device there s also a little led light that you can use a a flashlight not something ill really be use but it would be good for camping or if you listen to music to go to sleep at night it beat have to get up if you just need a little light there s a micro usb slot that you can use to play music also another function i will not be use since my music be on my iphone the button be pretty obvious for the function but just in caseplaypause do exactly what it show m stand for mode which will turn onof the function bluetooth micro sd card or aux you be use i love the skip previous song button that be also the volume button sign press once go to the next song hold it down to increase the volume sign press once go to the previous song hold it down to decrease the volume now to the sound i be very surprised at the sound quality of this speaker for a small little thing that fit in the palm of my hand it loud the sound be pretty clear too there s a voice when you connect or disconnect for realom bluetooth and aux not sure if it do the same for the micro sd card since i do not use those the instruction be not the great but i like to figure out function myself anyways i receive this item at a discount price for evaluation and my honest review overall this be a great speaker and the current selling price of 3499 be something i would pay at ross for a speaker like this but probably would not have the same quality i ve pay 30 for a bulkier speaker that do not play a loud,Good
whenever i need something for my pc especially a cable or sd card etc i usually check to see if there be an amazonbasics version of whatever i m purchase in my experience these item be usually the perfect combination of high quality and affordable this usb 30 cable be no exception this item come in amazon for realustration for realee packaging which be a perfectly sized carboard box to storehold the cable loosely coil and not sharply kink or bend the cable work well fit snugly and there be not anything much to say other than i m pleased this perform a intend while save i some cash in the process if you do not mind some amazon branding and logo on the cable end it a great cable,Good
while this might seem a great concept and idea use it you figure out quickly it a failure first off if you plan on use this for a cell phone the size of the unit make it impossible to connect to a phone if a case be involve due to the large size a other have point out the slide mechanism will fail and often lock up it really cheaply make for realom lightweight plastic and will come apart in time the well idea be to get a normal 30 usb drive and use a short usb female to usb micro male which cost about 2 i ve add some image which might help other when compare size and dimension something i wish i have before waste my time,Average

i have mixed feeling about blue yeti mic pro gain adjustment possible before analog to digital conversion multiple pattern plug for earphone input monitoring without lag low internal noise level driver le mute button on mic con easily flop 90 degree for realom vertical to horizontal position smacking metal against metal really hard no strain reliever for usb cord worry about gain adjustment knob failure annoying list a window audio output device via headphone plug always confuse i would be nice to disable output device with software or a switch annoying while record own voice with audacity application the disturbing finding that there be consistently le headroom on bottom side of zero level than on topside of the zero level positive side of waveform will have headroom while negative side will bottom out clip first i really can not figure out this unbalance since there be no apparent dc offset in silent part of record what because this wish list would be great if there be one extra bolt hole where a cord strain reliever could attach with a bolt for example 14 inch or 6 mm thread would be be great workaround for cord issue be to buy a wooden peg for realom hardware store sand peg down untoday i learned it can be jam into the mic stand hole see picture 16 zip tie cord to wooden peg voila a cord strain reliever also problem with attach pop filter drill a couple 14 inch hole into stand allow zip tie the pop filter securely to the stand in aftermath if i decide to buy a second mic i probably settle for a simple cardioid pattern only with gain adjustment make over the usb interface rather than a physical mic knob the risk of driver issue obviously would become a downside in a design without knob damned if do damned if do not driver blue yeti be a unique design but there be a fair chance there be a more practical 16 bit mic out there,Average

review a a set keyboard this be a really good keyboard for the price it not a mechanical keyboard and you can tell right away however i do not think that s how it market anyways i be look for a good allaround keyboard for light gaming look and feel nice and for a good price this definitely fit the bill build quality be a little well than i expect at the price point it feel solid and the key feel pretty good bear in mind this be the keyboard style with the funky return key and backslash in the middle row which if you re not use to can be for realustrating at first but since you can see that beforehand you ll know what you re get into and do require some getting use to fortunately my work have these kind of keyboard so it be not a problem for i in fact i m use this keyboard for this review if you re not use to that i really like the color they be vibrant without be too bright there be several option first you can just have it stay a solid color and can rotate between the 3 individuallygreen light blue dark blue you can have it pulse on one color or have it pulse between all 3 color i tend to just pick one color and go with it green be my personal favorite mouse the mouse have a great feel to it i like the braid cabling and the length be just right the clicking feel good and the dpi be good enough for causal gaming and daytoday use i really like the color and design i do not believe there s a way to stay on a single color for realom what i have see but i prefer it go through all the color anyways look really cool mouse pad it a good size and really accommodate the bundled mouse the mouse glide on it smoothly and i have not have a problem and i do not realize it there which be a good thing however the sharp edge on the mouse will catch on the outside stitching occasionally and this would be my only minor complaint besides the minor complaint about the stitching getting catch on the mouse occasionally this be a great casual gaming set for the price it look awesome with my alienware alpha and really complete the look i love the color and the overall feel honestly it just look awesome i would highly recommend this set,Good

5 when they first come in bluetooth setup be easy seem pretty good do it job connect your phone to radio via bluetooth 1 could not get the tf reader to play music not sure if i have to make sure i only have 1 file folder with music in the sd card but yeah manual do not have anything to help you on that 1 i feel like connect your phone via phone jack v bluetooth be clear so it fail the the main reason why i buy this bluetooth function 1 this device just start talk in chinese i think i mean it stoday i learnedl automatically connect with my phone but it no long say thing in english it say when it connect or connect and the manual do not have anything about change language setting update otiumdirect team contact i and send i a new item to replace what i have i will update my review a i receive the package 61016 1star for costumer service update 061716 i receive the replacement product for realom the seller and first thing i notice be the box be different the first one i receive do not have their name otium on it but the second one have do this mean i receive a fake item the first time i do not know the two actual fm transmitter look the same regardless anyway let get down to business the tf card actually work on the first fm transmitter i get i find out that the transmitter do not support the 64 g micro sdxc this be not mention in the manual the music will automatically play when you have a card instal and it always start for realom the beginning of your playlist the music will just go in order i do not know how this be determined and there be no other way of cycling thru your music other than hit the previous or next button i think the tf card function would be well use if you have audio book instead of song playlist in regard of the language problem i have with the first item i get it do not happen untoday i learned about a week of have the transmitter the new transmitter i get i ve only use for a day so i can not guarantee that the problem will not reoccur however the seller do contact i the first time and mention that i could change the language setting by pressingholde the circle button untoday i learned the englishchinese language option appear both transmitter be unable to do this so only time can tell if i will end up have another transmitter that will speak in chinese or not it honestly be not that big of a problem since the only thing it do be say whether your phone be connect or ready to pair i actually get use to the chinese language already and lastly i m not sure if it a placebo effect but the second transmitter i receive seem to have well signal i have not have to change the station or hear static noise because of lose signal on the radio station but it only be a day and i need to travel a bit more into the city or away to verify this final thought this product do what it suppose to do connect your phone via bluetoothphone jack tf card be a fancy addition but you d most likely will not be use it charge work one more thing that would have be nice be if you be able to jump station like 877 to 981 with have to press the ch button 100x i think you re suppose to be able to press the circle button then ch but i can not seem to do it right i ve only try this with the first item that i get and fail maybe it another defect the first one have i have to try it on the second transmitter but i will not be return to make an update for that,Good

this review be for the hauppauge wintvdualhd dual model not the 955q single tuner version well the only main difference be that the wintv have two tuner instead of one this product be far for realom perfect but i be give it 5 star simply because i do love this little device and i do not see anything well out in the market it really make a great home theater addition especially for projector your mileage will also greatly vary depend on your locationantenna performance you will not get it with the include cheap antenna it so nice be able to watch tv right on your computerrecordpauseetc i first buy the old model hauppauge 1191 wintvhvr955q which only have one tuner can only watch one channelrecord one show when i later realize they have the wintvdualhd model where they add two tuner to be able to watchrecord two channel now i have to get it i have no idea why anyone would buy the single tuner version when the dual model be price around the same and easily a no brainer well choice this be a real advantage than have a regular tv of be able to watchrecord two show at once you do not have to actually leave the wintv program open once you schedule a recording of course your computer stoday i learnedl have to be on because the capture process run in the background of your computer recording file size will depend on the channel because network do not all broadcast at the same bandwidthresolution overtheair for example cbs recording take up a lot of space also look way clearersharper because they broadcast at high resolutionbandwidth than other network however you should expect most show recording to be gig in size recording be save a t file pro watch 2 channel simultaneously or record one show while watch another or record two show include remote great for htpc closed caption it will not record the caption show signal strengthled green mean strong signal con software need workfeel outdate they need to add a builtin tv guidescheduler on the application interface itself and make more recording easiersimplierconvenient with just a click however instead it just add a program guide shortcut link on the desktop that open up the browser to a website call titantv where you then have to click on the show hit the record button link that pop up where it will then save a tvpi file to your computer you have to then clickopen that file to actually schedule into the application too much work than it should be the include antenna be absolute junk do not use it too weak to get channel if you re use multiple monitor drag the window to another screen while tune into a channel it will most likely crash to prevent the wintv software for realom crash you will want to pause the video first drag and then resume play run hot i wish they would make one that connectswork for smartphonetablet,Good

per my subject this be an extremely flawed amazon product list that should really be at minimum 23 separate product page a the different flavor of asus portable usb screen be very different for realom each other skim the review i suspect the asus zenscreen flavor would get generally positive review if list by itself while some of the other with flimsy nylon cover and other shortcoming would get more negative review this review be for the asus zenscreen usbc 1 a mention in the instruction your laptop will likely need a displaylink driver instal for this to work properly on usba to usbc if this be for use with a work laptop that you might lack access to install driver for you should be wary of this limitation 2 the zenbooks magnetic cover be a must while the ability to use a pen a a kickstand be a cute feature i can not see myself transport this without the magnetic cover a this be both protective and allow for very easy multhanks in advancengle mount landscape a well a portrait portrait mode be especially helpful when writingreviewe lengthy code see pic 3 i be very impressed with how good this screen look a a portable addon that say i would only use this while hard wire a this will drain a laptop battery extremely fast,Good
first the prosthe player have good sound the battery last for day where other i have have that just last for hour it have a lot of feature like fm radio picture video and a voice recorder it load quickly the con be it come with no headphone you can not listen to the sd card and the local folder music at the same time it annoying to switch between they if you have a lot of music i can not figure out a way to add music to my sd memory card for realom the player i have never have trouble do that before i have to use another mp3 player to add song to the sd card it do not start back at the last song i be listen too when i turn it on the shuffle be almost always the same listit do not really shuffle well i do not like the volume control in normal mode you have to hold down the down button which be in the for realont to increase and decrease the volume there be no side volume button there be an easy mode but it stoday i learnedl in the for realont you have to hold down the middle button and then you can not get to your home page when you re in easy mode and you have to hold down the button again to exit side button would be more convenient it come in a rather plain brown cardboard box overall it an alright player not the good but not the bad either,Average
it ok however the one major design flaw be that the port be too close together i do manage to fit flash drive in 3 of the port even though they just barely fit but i have to put a cable in the 4th port because one of the flash drive i want to use be too wide i do like the fact that each port can be turn onoff individually it do arrive quickly and be a describe with minimal packaging,Average

important note if you buy this make sure you have the late firmware 306 at the time of this write old firmware will cause the radio to randomly not power up after you turn the car off and on professional installer will not automatically do this i need a simple replacement for the radio in my 2004 toyota camry nonjbl a the cd and tape player both die the price be good at 125 and prime shipping make it even well this review cover the radio a well a some doityourself installation issue what i like large display with decent sized button usb memory stick port cd player with support for common cd music format ability to customize the lighting color to match the toyota dash display there be other option which i do not care about it seem now to support pandora there be a manual sticker on the faceplate but it be not clear how i be not a bit fan of pandora so i do not pursue it what i do not like lack of decent documentation the manual it come with have almost no useful information the main manual be only online in html format so you can not easily print it out to refer to it it be not quite up to date either if you let the display color cycle through a be the default they will be at time unreadable especially during the day due to certain color in the cycle be too dark to read this unit be advertise a come with a toyota mount kit and faceplate but kenwood email support could not tell what year carsit would work with the send a can letter that tell i the installer would know and offer a list of local installer of the installer list one be a best buy close for two year another a west marine that have no clue what i be talk about and the other two be too far away to even bother when i try another email there be no reply i find out after purchase it be not a 2004 camry so i have to order a mount kit for realom a separate source this should have be in the documentation the radio sensitivity be not quite a good a the oem radio close but i could not pickup some station that i normally listen to there do not appear to be a manual tuning option that i could find so i could not set the button for the station i want but the auto scan skip when i first get the radio up and run it would for realequently stop work require a push of the reset button on the for realont panel come to find out i have version 303 of the firmware with the late be 306 an upgrade fix the problem the upgrade be remarkably easy after finally navigate to the proper page on the kenwood website in spite of some break link this be likely what reviewer maurice delgado experience a his unplugging and plug in be the same a press the reset the upgrade would have probably fix his radio but it be not advertise there be a cool function that sync the clock to the radio signal but it be an hour off i do not know if this be a dst problem but there be no way i can see to adjust it if you do the install yourself you will need a mount kit and not necessary but highly recommendedan intermediate wiring harness try to find a decent schematic of the toyota wiring harness online be for realuitless and i do not want to buy the whole repair manual just to get it buy the aftermarket harness do make it easy you will need some way to join the wire between the new radio harness and the aftermarket harness i use quick splice wire joiner but solder and heat shrink or inline connector and crimp will do too use the aftermarket harness a an intermediary make this wiring process become a simple matching of wire color with the harness for realom new radio to the intermediate harness this be not particularly well document either but it be sufficient to get the job do once this be do you simply plug one end of the complete harness into the radio and the other into the exist car plug very simple and allow the new radio to be remove and the old one reinstall because you leave the old connector intact could not find a well fitting mount kit but what i get work well enough just look a little cheap note this be dependent on what aftermarket kit be available for your car and be not a function of the kenwood radio if you have a different car you may find a mount kit with a perfect fit after all be say an do it be a process that turn out pretty well except for the mount kit faceplate i will review that elsewhere the radio after upgrade work reliably and the support of the different cd music file format and the usb stick be real plus for i i will try to post a photo of the complete installation when i get a chance,Good
so far the board have be great for everything except for overclocke not that you can not overclock because you can but you need to have more than a basic understanding of overclocke to do it on this board it do not have the usual asus auto oc that all prior asus board have hadhave it do however have some auto section to help with overclocke need and the board have not melt under some of the condition i ve place on it so that s a plus the uefi be weird to work with but you get use to it there s plenty of guide out there on the net to help someone with overclocke this board though so do not let the complexity of option blow you away this board have a lot of everything on it like usb port 30 20 and all usb on this board be backwards compatible which be a plus there s a couple of esata port on the board it also have the new usb flashback bios button which have a designate usb port to use for quick bios update for realom a thumb drive very nifty to use inside the board be aesthetically pleasing on the eye and quite easy to color match if you want to to your other component there be a total of 8 sata port on the board max ram be 32 gb 1866 i currently use 32 gb 1600 with 99927 have to set it manually for this and everything be fine corsair vengeance ram use the ram slot be not like typical one so do not for realeak out if you get this board the slot only have one set of clickin on one side and the other side be just a hook post for the other side of the stick i think i have a defunct board when i see that like a if the other post get break off but nope it design that way and it do work like that without issue the only real downside to this board and it really just a design flaw be that you need to hook up your sata before you put a video card on this board most gfx be quite long in length and a an example i use a xfx r9 290x and it literally cover the entire mobo for realom the left to right this create a slight issue a the card be so long that it literally cover my sata port 4 of they what would be your first four for hdoptical so just be aware of that so that you at least hook your line to the mobo first before placement of your massive gfx i use a red theme and the mobo color do not detract for realom the rest of my setup an image below will show the gfx blockage of the sata port,Good

first ill start by say that i have a of this review build 6 htpc use this case in the last 4 month i originally buy this to house my htpc after i decide i no long want a desktop tower sit next to my entertainment center with that a a limitation on my size choice i search for week and keep come across this case but the price tag honestly scare i since my last experience with a specifically design case for an htpc be le than stellar but after compare it to other i keep come back to it and eventually decide it would fit what i need update since there seem to be an issue with people know the exact dimension of this case they be 440mmw x 175mmh x 425mmdor in inch 173inw x 68inh x 167ind update since my original review i have now build 8 htpc with this case and none have have any issue update also something i forget to mention this case be rack mountable it have rack mount point on the side so now on to the actual review pro space lot and lot of space positive pressure design with filter very nice look the case look and act well build aesthetic it look well than my receiver and other component easily the good look component in my home theater allow for full size component room for more hard drive than you could need removable drive cage with handle room for 10 internal hard drive without adapter 8 35 inch bay 7 to the right of the 525 bay 1 to the left plus 2 25 mount above the 525 inch bay con for what i want this be a con but not for most people 2 80 mm fan mount on the back above io panel good for exhaust fan but no standard liquid cool solution fit on an 80 mm mount point a of this review the drive door trigger can be a pain to align to your dvdbluray drive because the door to not open when the button be press or to openclose constantly but with some adjust this be sort out honestly this case look more like a home theater component a oppose to a pc i get people ask fain real lifey often where my computer be since everything we watch run through it when i point it out they be truly surprised i have build 5 more htpc use this case thank to people see mine and love the look with these i have use nothing but full size component which be great since airflow and dimension restriction be not really a problem there be some to be aware of but ill cover those later the positive airflow keep the dust out i clean my filter out about 1 time per month with a dog and 2 cat in the house but i have not have any real dust in the case it get pick up by the filter in 4 month no dust issue i m extremely pleased with this case and i will continue to use it if people want i to build they a home theater pc it be make of quality steel even empty with the cover and drive cage out it do not bend or twist this be a big issue with many htpc case some thing you do need to watch for be video card height and length the case only have 140 mm of height above the motherboard so be sure you be not use an extra tall video card also if you plan to fill up your hard drive case with drive pay attention to the length clearance get tight with hard drive mount in the bay at about 9 inch although with 8 place to mount 35 inch drive and 2 25 bay along with the 2 525 bay you have ton of way to avoid interference with your video card pay attention if you be use a tall cpu cooler the max height of the cooler be 140mm also go with a extra wide one might make cable route difficult for your disc drive the removable drive cage be a lifesaver when it come to mount your drive it be simple to pull out and put back thank to the handle this be important since 5 drive plus bluray and an ssd could be difficult to situate without the handle ok now i ve gush about the case let look at the short list of con i have first the 2 80mm fan mount above the io panel be useful for fan but i really want to do a liquid cool solution but none of the standard seal model utoday i learnedize 80mm mount so i compromise and just put some fan in for most people this be a good thing to have 2 additional fan location but i really want to do liquid cool the 2 drive door have trigger that sit against the openclose button on your drive these can be a little tricky to align i have this issue on my asus bluray but it be much simple with a sony one so to wrap up this could very well be the case you re look for if you want a case to fit in just about any home theater set this work perfectly it be worth the price and i would recommend it to almost anyone the only thing it do not have that some might want be an lcd screen but for i it a great fit these case be very versatoday i

the micro usb port be a bit too shallow there be a bit more than 2 mm gap between this adapter and eight of my various usb micro cable i ve attach a photo that demonstrate this issue do i get a b stock grade item please comment if you have find a well recommendation for a micro usb to usbc adapter update now that i have my nexus 6p i do some charger testing when my phone battery be at 30 full i use a 24a newtrent charger and a samsung note 3 charger along with an inline usb current meter i compare use this adapter on 5 high quality usba to usbmicro cable to the usbc cable that come with the nexus 6p net result be there be no difference in charge current between the cable with this adapter and the stock nexus cable charge rapidly be always display on the phone lock screen i use some gaffer tape to secure my ill fit adapter to a heavy duty usb monoprice coil cord that s use for car charging and have not have any issue i want to try data transfer with this adapter but start with the nexus 6p cable first and be instead thwart by window driver issue on one for realont and a chromebook steal the usb mount for realom my ubuntu chroot ill let other comment on use this adapter for datum transfer please note that i only use this adapter with my nexus 6p and have no intention of use it to charge my chromebook pixel nor do i know if this product be design to the proper usbc standard,Average
bukm smart power strip tower be a nifty item to have if you be like i and you have multiple electronic device to plug in and keep charge it surprisingly lightweight but do not feel flimsy it feel like something that will last particularly since item like this do not get move around a lot the tower itself turn on a base which make access all side of the tower a breeze there be also a handle unobtrusive look on the top in case you want to grab it and relocate the tower to another location in your home my only negative comment about this be the use of white plastic and black plastic on the same item i would prefer it all to be black or all white just my personal taste and it do not effect how the item function the number of plugin and usb port be more than adequate there be 10 plugin and 4 usb port this be great for i because i usually have a laptop chromebook ipad phone and kindle charge not to mention a bluetooth speaker and the wiiu controller this powerful power tower be worth the price i receive this tower for a discount price in exchange for my honest review but i absolutely plan on buy an additional tower at full cost to place in my office,Good
i really like this battery currently the version will the charge capacity status light i m use it instead of the traditional powertank for a celestron 6se telescope just to give a sense of scale i m attach photo of it next to a powertank rest on the top of the tripod mount and in the location i intend to velcro it on the support arm while i ve be test it i ve just be stick it on the former position but it be small enough to velcro so i will it charge in about the same amount of time and run for a long a the powertank which be not a surprise since they be rate about the same the size difference however make this a huge improvement when move a telescope around to remote sitesor even in one backyard since celestron new scope be power by lithium ion battery in the mount there should be no issue with make this switch for an external power supply the only tricky thing be because by the somewhat awkwardly translate instruction when charge the unit should be on when you be do turn it off if you do not use it for several month top it off every three or so,Good
package be deliver on time and in good condition easy installation the weight capacity of the mount be more important than the size it can hold the product description state fit screen size 1030 inch with weight capacity 44198 lb yet it hold my 34 lg perfectly and like a champ because it weight only 16 lb,Good
product arrive a describe i use it to hardwire a rexing r1 dashcam it be small enough that i be able to hide it easily under the dash near the fuse box and the cable be long enough to run up under the pillar and to the rear view mirror it have only be a couple day sure but it appear to be work great installation be very easy i crimp the red wire to a fuse tap or addacircuit and the black wire to ground i use the radio circuit a it turn off when the car be off but you could also attach it to something that be always on if you want to use the parking mode on your dash cam the 2 amp rating be more than enough for any dash cam both red and black wire be prestrippe the only tool i need be the wrench to loosen a bolt for the ground connection and needle nose plier to get the fuse out i think the only thing i would suggest be i wish this be offer a a bundle with the fuse tap and spare fuse,Good
this product do not do what it say in it description the wording work internationally be incredibly deceive a this product own label actually list only 120v ac with no mention of the 220v that would be need to plug directly into most international power technically you could plug this into a power transformer when you travel internationally but i do not believe that be what most people would think be necessary when they work internationally in the amazon listing and would very likely void any product warranty a be typically the case with power strip additionally travel power transformer be not intend to have more than one product plug into they and the obvious intention of this belkin power strip be to provide multiple outlet you could also just plug it in to 220v and see if it hold up i travel with a couple of 120v power strip in my gear bag and they ve work fine for year with 220v but have have one that immediately smoke and die when with 220v this belkins protection feature may well fail when plug into 220v have not try it keep in mind that this be not a power converter and if you do choose to try plug this product into 220v and it work it would not allow you to plug in a product that be not intend for use with 220v power or usb devise i m not even sure if the usb port would function correctly when plug into 220v so i would not test it out with my smartphone my trip do not come with in the return period for amazon so i m stuck with this,Bad
good product a a portable monitor it go to be hard to find similar build quality portable monitor it slick think and light weight i usually use my ipad a a second monitor via the app duet but it a little bit small to work with excel so i move to asus monitor the first impression be light weight good screen wellmade case but text in the screen be not good to read many text because it little blurry my14inch lenovo screen have crisp text 19201080 the screen size 14 v 15 might be the big reason but asuss one be not comfortable when it come to read article there be a couple of backlight bleeding on the right side,Average
i ve post picture of this unit there be a definite manufacturingdesign flaw with this unit the top lid come unhinge after 12 hour of use there be no clamp to attach the lid to the unit instead there be a large waxy foam adhesive between the lid and the hard disk drive after some hour of usage the unit will naturally get rather warm this heat because the waxy foam adhesive foam to become soft and malleable the lid detach itself without any pressure thereby expose the hard drive once the unit and wax adhesive cool you can reattach the lid but there be stoday i learnedl pressure point on the corner where the lid do not completely seat again the bevel edge push down on the pressure point to hopefully lock the lid because it to spring back overall the seagate disk inside be quiet and appear to be reliable the provide cable be of industrial strength bonus point for that but unfortunately i could not risk my backup datum on an enclosure that would not stay sealed,Bad
i really need an sd reader and think that extra usb 3 port for my tiny desktop would be helpful so decide on the unitek 3 port usb 3 hubcard reader move file around for realom a drive out of a recently dead laptop i be pleased with the throughput and copy file 50 mb each for realom a sandisk extreme pro 64 gb sd old 95mbs version to an external usb3 sata 4 tb drive i be get 80mbs throughput see screen shoot by the way i have have two external usb 3 hdd each without it own power adapter run off of the unit while simultaneously have an sd card in the unit and have have no problem move file between drive and i only mention that a some have ask about it i do not have any cf card,Good
great for the money it replace a 4x50w pioneer it just a loud it do not have dual subwoofer out just a single brown aux out wire so i use the rear aux out for my sub it start up very fast maybe five second,Good
these work really well but unfortunately be poorly make in a dark room these will let you see any nonbacklit keyboard clearly however one of the three in the package i receive do not function at all and the remain two run hot there be what should be a heat sink on the back of the light but it not closely enough couple to the led strip mount inside i suppose i cold fix that with some thermal paste the fit in the usb port be a little loose not terrible but it could be well a for how they work here be two photo of my notebookone without the light one with you can really see the difference,Average
i go ahead and spend the extra 400 to get the usb30 version for future compatibility to address part of andreis review regard the hidden clip it certainly there see the picture for detail part of the problem be that it very difficult to release since the only avenue you have to it it via the bezel itself and you can really only pry it wrong i carefully use a very small flatblade screwdriver to for realee it and the rest of the assembly be easy a to the enclosure itself it solid on the outside plastic for the drive carrier but stamp steel to handle the pcb and connector and use an initio inic3619pn bridge chip overall build quality be good it have only a single overspecced 16v electrolytic cap in it and the soldering look to be of average quality the only other fault i could find would be that it pretty easy to push the drive just that little bit too far into the cage so that it bind when attempt to eject i would recommend the following 1 make the drive cage completely out of stamp metal to reduce wonkiness of the mold plastic 2 get rid of the back bezel configuration and add some simple ejection mechanism for the drive itself there should not be any reason to twiddle around with the clip stuff and would make swap drive easy overall it certainly worth the 20odd buck and give i a nice look external drive,Good
say it fit a 25 1 tb hd but it do not i have a seagate for realeeplay 1 tb hd and it do not fit and there be no way it will fit it not something i m do wrong my hd be 12 thick so any hd that be 12 thick it will not fit,Bad
for a moderate gamer whose computer sit a floor above her router and can not afford to mar her home with a 150 ft ethernet cable this thing be something of a godsend i mainly want a strong adapter since my wifi suffer for realom terrible ping spike this puppy only decrease my ping for realom 22 m to 17 m and increase my upload speed by le than 2 mbps however my download speed go for realom 963 mbps to 6803 mbps my father be amazed when he see this improvement that s practically the maximum speed for what we buy installation be quite straightforward a other reviewer have say just install the driver for realom the main website before physically instal this card i do not bother use the package cd since the driver on it be outdate i like that the antenna stand be magnetize put the stand onto my case rather than have it take up space on my desk be wonderful this pup be pricey but it do it job for sure,Good
it fail while travel in a fain real lifey isolated part of the world just when i need it so why be i give it 5 star well i contact western digital they of course want the drive info date of purchase etc i could not provide most of this a i be travel and do not carry old receipt with i after a few very polite email and phone call back and forth and because of the complexity of the logistic due to my traveling and my some what advanced knowledge of computer my case be transfer up to management level and i end up deal with jimmy l i do not know if i be allow to mention name we speak a couple of time and the conversation be quite pleasant and jimmy l be actually insistent on replace my drive and try to save my datum i have work in it for 17 year i use to be a reseller wd be always my drive of choice because of their price and quality and rma be extremely time consume and do not make you any money off they so hard drive be not something you cheap out on datum of course be the most valuable part of any computer i also preach back up and redundancy to my client and this be an unusual case of i practice what i preach i no long do this and when i purchase drive it be through amazon i just want to stress that i be in no way bias or affiliate with western digital or amazoncom amazoncom set the bar for customer service this be a rare case where there exemplary customer service be meet or exceed not only be they willing to have their third party company attempt to salvage my datum i be shocked to learn that if necessary they be willing to do a hardware retrieval this involve dismantle the drive rebuild it replace faulty spindle etc and can run into the thousand of dollar i use to tell client after a hard drive crash that lose they all their precious baby picture that it be cheap to have a new baby than do datum retrieval in some case not only be they willing to do this but they be willing to retrieve the datum and return it to i on a new 2 tb my passport ultra metal edition very good review for this drive on amazon via ups all at their own expense via a traceable expedite courier it be on it way a i write this be a true story contact i if you wish and i will forward the email with name etc redact i be in no way affiliate with wd or any of it subsidiary but i think the least i could do be write this review a way of thank you know when you watch the news and you wish they would throw in just one nice story this feel like that to i hencethat be why i be give a fail drive 5 star and why i will never buy another brand of hard drive again i can not recommend western digital enough and i will post a picture and review of the new drive after i have bench mark it sign a very pleased customer they be true to their word and i have already receive the new drive picture and bench mark score attach,Good

ok case but only if you need it to be tiny in term of size go fine with a miniitx and a 6100 t cpu with a stock intel cooler you have to remove the for realont panel to be able to manouver two screw and pop 3 plastic pin and most likely you also have to remove the power board on the left of the case 2 screw it quite difficult to work without do that but have some patience you get a decent setup space and ability to route cable be very limited so it be almost impossible to have a cleanneat setup most end up look like a rat nest stoday i learnedl ok if you manage to clear out enough cable to have good airflow my problem with this case be the psu not exactly the external power brick but the board itself inside the case and the correspond connector very low quality my first one work for 4 or 5 power cycle and then borke would not even pas the paperclip test the case i get be clearly a return for realom another unlucky user i get a replacement and it work for slightly over one year during that time the pc would sometimes turnoff for no apparent reason rarely and when turn off would sometimes not turn on again unless you wiggle the power connector a bit eventually it stop work completely pro tiny just enough for a miniitx 2 ssd and cool there be not many alternative if you want a case a small a possible with no spaceweight waste and all you need be a low tdp cpu ram and a 2 25 storage unit actually 3 if your motherboard support m2 ssd fain real lifey cool even with all the limited space fit standard intel stock coolerfan and not much more con poor quality plastic on for realont and one of the side panel very easy to scratch low quality psu circuitry plus le efficient than even a picopsu even the jack be poorly secure and wobble tight case without washer prone to short if you re not careful with the assembly and some metal part contact no usb 30 port only one of the side panel be aluminum the rest be fain real lifey for realagile plastic overall i get this case mostly to save space and to have a silent system with the low power psuthis kind of backfire since the intel stock cooler be very noisy and you might end up use it because not much more fit also be small there be no space for a large quiet fan although i give it a it ok i do not really recommend this unless you absolutely can not have something big than vesa i replace it with a mstech c100 which be also a fain real lifey small case but with a little bit extra space which allow installaton of a betterquieter cooler and even a quiet large fan if need also it have a 300w psu builtin and cost le than the antec overall an ok case but definitely need an upgrade version i d give it 45 if it have a more reliable psu and 55 if it have that and usb3 update august 2015 i ve have a couple of issue with case when it would just not turn on i be unable to troubleshoot the specific because but it seem to be relate to some shorting of the power board which be very expose while simply squeeze the case the system would turn on eventually it turn on and i just let it run this be a very tight case with everything touch everything else and poor electrical isolation so expect these glitch also i do not trust the psu at all and expect it to fail soon consider that my first unit already have a defective psu i do not recommend the isk 110 anymore it be highly likely that it will fail before one year of use let alone reach the rest of the 2year warranty update nov 2016 issue with the system not power up or turn off get bad like many here the power connector have issue and the electrical part of this case be a mess i give up on it do not bother with it it be cute and practical but not woth it get about a year of use out of it,Average
i go to upgrade the bios with a skylake chip i have for the kaby lake chip i buy and it turn out it ship with the most current bios version if i d have know it would have save i the hassle of set everything up and swap cpu oh well hope this help someone else who do not have a skylake chip to upgrade the bios,Good

i like that it do not get a ridiculously hot a my goto pick for a usb drive of this stature the sandisk ultra fit however the drive just be not a fast write speed be abysmal and reach just about the top end of the bandwidth afford by usb 20 read speed be decent but a touch slow than those of the sandisk it an okay drive with generally decent construction and design i m go to be use it mainly to move file for realom one place to another rather than any kind of storage so for that application it adequate but disappointing consider a cheap fast rival exist,Good
so there be pro and con with this radio some of the con might be unfounded but here go pro fantastic radio reception quality pick up station way well than the previous radio play everything i have throw at it mp3 mp4 well that be all i have back up camera work a expect even though i have buy the camera year ago very light weight and about half the size of a radio that contain dvd playback this one do not have one con the quality feel off hard to explain the metal feel thin the plastic i do not know it just the feel bootup time be a bit long i can back up fully before i even get the welcome screen would like to have have well documentation i wind up mix up the backup camera with the handbrake wire because it be not clear if it be pin 1 or 2 there be color list for the speaker but not for the other would like to have some sort of ambient sensor to tame down the radio light level at night not a big deal after ask a specific question regard the backup video camera the seller reply with a generic reply that have nothing to do with the question i would have prefer i do not know over a generic response i hope it will last a little while,Good
i purchase this for an external usb 3 jbod enclosure i will need for my pc at the moment i have not receive the jbod enclosure but i test this cable with an intel x25v 40 gb ssd in a msi coolmax hd250tnu3 usb 3 enclosure use a pcie x1 renesas 2port evga eu30 card and see hd tune 255 return the follow stat for a 4 mb block size transfer rate min 1346 mbsec max 1492 mbsec average 1445 mbsec access time 01 m burst rate 736 mbsec this be with the ssd have 122 gb for realee of 372 gb when the ssdenclosure be attach directly to the eu30 without use the extension cable i see the follow result transfer rate min 1380 mbsec max 1494 mbsec average 1442 mbsec access time 01 m burst rate 745 mbsec my conclusion no real speed loss when use the extension cable other observation the cable be nice and thick the malefemale end feel strong and unlikely to break even with thousand of insertionsremoval update when i use the extension cable with the nst640su3bk enclosure the disk would appear and disappear in window remove the cable fix the issue,Good
i have quite a few external drive so i m pretty familiar with their general spec so honestly i be not expect too much out of the seagate expansion drive other than the usb 30 connector there s really nothing really new about this drive the basic it a 25 5400 rpm green drive which mean the disk have a habit of go to sleep when not in use but it also mean that it pretty light on the power consumption it also quiet and have a very low heat signature average readwrite speed over usb 30 3025 mbps see customer image for my benchmark result what it good for at 500 gb this drive be pretty small when compare to it 24 tb neighbor however this drive be nice because it completely powered via usb and have a small footprint the portability come in handy when a usb memory stick just do not have enough room and this be where the expansion might be the good fit a an it consultant it nice to be able to have an extra hdd portable enough to take along on business trip it large enough that you can hold presentation installation binary and even a few movie or tv show for the long flight or boring hotel room while the speed be not phenomenal you probably do not want to run graphically intense game directly for realom the drive it be quick enough to handle play 720p video without flicker or stutter i do not try 1080p sorry the bad at 500 gb this thing be tiny by today standard and the 750 gb version be not much well unfortunately once you start look at the 1 tb and 15 tb drive they get physically large and lose their compactness if you re plan on use this drive a an external storage for movie music and image you ll probably find yourself fill it up rather quickly and wish you buy a drive with more room for growhat the hell i know that some people probably be look at this drive a a possible backup drive to use in case of a hdd failure on their main drive but keep in mind that this be also a standalone drive with no physical redundancy and drive that you physically move around generally tend to go bad before stationary drive like those in workstation do conclusion the expansion drive fill a niche but it a very specific niche if you plan on travel and need a drive that s ok on speed and use very little power this thing might be the perfect fit a an generic storage dump the size hamper it usefulness and a multiterabyte option be probably a well choice,Good
update 12717 i have spend over two more week battle this problem i have now clear over 6 tb of space for realom my drobo inithanks in advancelly it show up in the dashboard a clear then suddenly it disappear and go back to show the red alert i suspect a drive be bad so i power off the unit and individually check each drive i ve do various thing include force a rebuild identify and replace a drive that be have a few sector error they be not show in the dashboard i have to power down and test the drive separately and many more effort then i finally discover the because a few month ago i have set the drobos second partition to be a backup destination for time machine when select it i decide why not encrypt it so i tick the box to encrypt and enter the password turn out that because the drobo like to fake out the file system that there be more space than there actually be when the mac try to encrypt it it fil up the disk and then put the drobo into this red zone condition in my case because the encryption be run in the background for a few week i do not realize this be what be go on turn out it never get beyond 70 complete for encryption but be stoday i learnedl try i have now cancel that process and hope for a recovery however my update review to 2 star below stoday i learnedl stand while drobo claim to make these device super easy to use this kind of problem be the opposite of ease of use if you sell and market a device of ease of use there should not be hide conflict like this with the second most prevalent computer operating system on the planet far this problem be be experience by user at least a far back a 2011 i find a thread on a forum where someone encounter the same thing which be why i finally figure this out i love the concept of the drobo but i have waste far too much time and angst on this to be able to recommend or support the product update 112017 well the drobo be great untoday i learned it start run out of space i m not talk about the space available a report in the finder on the mac i m talk about the actual space on the device sometime recently it go past the yellow warning of 20 for realee yes drobo expect that if you have a 2895 tb raid like mine you will keep 579 tb of it for realee and clear to avoid any kind of slowdown that s a large amount of space to keep for realee anyway i do not i get that number down to around 2 tb because i be do some intensive data reorganization i be go to for realee the space later this turn into a nightmare at some point the drobo just start consume all the available space untoday i learned it get to 2 gb leave not tb gb i ve attach a screenshot of the drobo dashboard where it read 4426 gb for realee space this read 4601 gb for realee space just a short while ago after i clear another 15 tb off the drive i have do repeat cycle of clear stuff off this drive amounting to at least 3 tb to get it out of the red zone and it insist on stay stick there it just eat any for realee space i ve clear up bad when operate in the red zone like this it be extremely slow it slow down the whole system to a crawl so i have a system and disk that operate like molasse that keep eat away space that i for realee and this have be go on for week this have now waste enough time that i will be replace the drobo with something more reasonable a soon a possible while i stoday i learnedl love the simplicityconcept of the drobo it be small detail like this one that make it very for realustrating to use over the long haul i would no long recommend the drobo to anyone but a light user who will keep the drobo within it limited perfect operating condition i m not a newbie to raid array i ve be use they since 2000 to store large amount of scientific datum i ve be interested in the concept of easilyexpansible storage for year whenever i need to expand an array to large disk and volume size it be painful and time consume with traditional raid it require a complete transfer of the datum to a different drive then completely rebuild the new expand volume for realom scratch before move the datum back i need a well solution than this to my everexpande datum need i be intrigue by the drobos however base on previous bad review of the drobo unit i d stay away for realom try one instead a few year back i purchase a na unit for realom another wellknown company that claim to also have an expandable raid setup that unit have work ok but have present various challenge 1 it really slow 2 it can only do time machine backup up to 4 tb total and they never specify this limitation in the advertising 3 expand the array with large drive be very slow and unreliable 4 it die for a while then magically come back to life etc i get feed up and decide to try the drobo 5d so far this unit have be the good raid i ve ever use it be very fast very easy to use quite reliable and i have already expand my array 3 time a i purchase large drive it be easy to use quiet and so far reliable pro fast both for deal with many small file and also for large file eg multigb video very easy to expand dashboard be easy to use i purchase the msata accelerator card and for my use with many small file it speed thing up even more it be fully maccompatible with no apparent issue the light on the for realont give a very good indication of what s happen do i say easy to use that count for a lot since my time be valuable con i have a thunderbolt cable that work with other device but not the drobo after swap it it work fine it seem sensitive in that regard limit to 17 tb per volume the unit itself can handle at least 40 tb but you be force to divide that up into small volume that s kind of a pain the tradeoff of raid i ve see review that trash drobo for use a proprietary format yet i presently own three other raid unit in addition to the drobo and the na each one do hardware raid5 in it own unique and proprietary way in fact just the other day one of the drive die in a generic unit i have format a raid5 after i power it off and insert a new drive it would not power back on now i m stuck have to order a new one to try to recover my datum it out of warranty this be no different than the drobo if you re use a hardwarebase raid whether drobo or x or y or z brand if the hardware fail you will have to get a new unit or do some fancy datum recovery the only way i can see avoid this be to use a softwarebase raid solution and those be slow the other alternative be to use a jbod a bunch of independent disk and that turn into a mess quickly i have over 30 at one point the other major tradeoff be that if you go with a fix raid solution expansion require another drive of the same size or large backup your raid i once think that raid be a way of avoid the need for a backup that be a long time ago and real life experience have teach i differently it vital to backup your drive whether they be raid or not the reason to use raid be not to avoid do backup it to have a high likelihood of get back up to speed quickly if a disk fail on this count it do not matter whether it a drobo or another brand the bottom line if you value your time this be a great unit i do a simple calculation of the value of my time and decide that the extra cost of the drobo be well worth it for the time it have already save i if you prefer save a few dollar to save time or if you like fiddle around with various raid setting and configuration then perhaps another le expensive unit may work well for you,Bad
i ve be buy the 5 tb seagate expansion drive for over a year and get at least 10 of they for the long time i be very pleased with they it an massive amount of datum and usb 3 for very little money though with the last 3 drive i have a reoccurring problem the new drive seem fine when i first connect it the write speed be around 130150mbps and everything work well after copy around 1 tb for some drive it happen early for some later the speed suddenly drop all the way to 2 or 3 mbps even format at this point do not change anything the drive basically become useless on top of all that a few of those bust drive even make a very distinct sound when power they down you could hear the disk slow down and it do not sound good at all whatever change with the late batch of drive it change they for realom one of the cheap backup solution to one of the most useless drive on the market very unfortunate,Bad
the 1 byone amplifier work the red light be on but instead amplify it weaken the signal with 15 i try indoor a ge 24702 viper amplified antenna and i receive many tv channel the tv transmitter be 12 mile far for realom my home later i try vision for realee antenna and after a for realactal antenna 485 mm by 500 mm which give i the good result the strength of signal be 70 to 80 and i get 48 solid channel add at antenna the amplifier of ge 24702 viper amplified antenna i gain 15 more strength of signal so 70 signal strength at tv be increase at 85 with 1 by one i get 55 strength of the signal instead of 70 with antenna only i decide to mount the antenna in attic and i buy the 1 byone amplifier in ebay it be true that something be wrong with this product but this be evidence that quality control do not exist at 1 byone amplifier manufacture so before throw at the trash i open the device a a proof that i have this i do not like this and i will discard away this 1 byone amplifier,Bad

very disappointed i originally get a usb 30 cable for realom another vendor but that turn out to be false advertising i figure that an amazon product should be well it be that s why it get 2 star the phone charge just fine whether plug into a wall socket or a pc although slowly thru the latter stoday i learnedl fast than prior vendor cable however there be no data transfer possible the pc do not recognize it and the phone do not see the pc the usb connection option be not available either upon connection this cable be much thick than most usb cable which may or may not be a good thing i will not be return it because i can use it to charge my phone in the car since i do not need the data transfer there and can always do that via bluetooth i get the 3footer just for that reason the original samsung cable be 5 foot which be too long for the car if you need data transfer however this be not the cable for you only the original samsung usb 30 cable seem to work a such and that s no long available anywhere it might be time to upgrade laugh out loud,Bad
i look like a real shrunken car perfect color combination with my silver mac book pro only the onoff switch be a bit hard to deal with,Good

probably the well look mobo in the market rgb be beutiful very sturdy heavy and stable due to it armor i will not recommend it for 2 way sli though and no chance to use 3 way sli it just not worth it but for single gpu no sharing on socket speed it a beast you will have to enable xmp profile in bios if you r use ram with speed 2133mhz coz it the default speed that will be detect other than that it a great board you honna need the manual for the q code do not throw it away,Good
i need a long cable extension so i could use my htc phone long sit anywhere in the house this cable be pretty nice and it thick have gold plate termination and seem high quality the medium bridge be very similar just a bit nice product a it have a bit more curved shape and the female end termination be not expose like the amazon basic one but i guess that do not really matter i have purchase the other medium bridge one before but i could not find it at least in this length i like the length and i d even recommend a long one and a few set,Good
i m a teacher and my school run out of projector before my classroom could get one since school start and i really need a projector i buy this one compare to all the other 4 type of donate projector in my school this one be by far the dim one the brightness be insanely low no matter how close the projector be to the wall even close all of the blind in my classroom do not help much my other complaint about this projector be that it blurry there be an option to bring the screen into focus and it work but only so much be a teacher for 9 year i know my way around projector and how they should work this product work but it not great if you can afford a more expensive one with a bright light i d recommend buy something else,Average
i ve be impress with all the amazon basic product i ve see so far and this be no exception it hit all the high point i want in a charge cable and the only thing they could have do to make i happy be to include the charger itself to remind you right off the bat this be usbc on both end so you will need a charger that have the ctype plug it will not work with old charger the thing i want in a charge cable be 1 high current to allow fast charging 2 length 3 maneuverability ill start with 3 because it something you do not think of a lot of cable be very rigid or have a sort of memory due to to thick of plastic without enough wire this mean then when i have my phone charging at my desk i orient it so i can read it but a soon a i let go the cord today i learnedt it away not a problem with the amazon cable there be plenty of give and if you give it a slight kink it will stay in that shape then there be length 3 ft be never enough for i the 6 ft combine with the previous point mean i can plug it in and get the cable right where i want it my wife also like how she can make use of that plug behind our headboard and stoday i learnedl have plenty to route to her night stand last and most important be the max current the internal wire size and quality do matter when you want to get a lot of electricity through it i ve have charger say they could supply 3 amp but could not rapid charge my 5x it turn out to be the cable with this one though there be no issue our phone charge just a fast a with the stock charger for realom lg prefect for get a quick charge before head out i have no complaint the cable do everything i want it throw in the sturdy plug and the strainrelief that give just enough and i think well be use this for a long time be think of grab another and i ve already recommend it to a coworker who s look for a new one,Good

simply fantastic first i do not buy this for realom amazon the deal at best buy and b and h be much sweet 99 and change and amazon be way more expensive this sharp micro component system be purchase after considerable research to fill a very specific niche requirement the primary system requirement excellent sound quality secondly it need to be a micro component system with a central ampreceiver cd radio and bluetooth detachablereplaceable speaker expandability to include auxphono rca and separate subwoofer out in the course of my research i find that in it price point the sharp be the only one that meet all the requirement list above other company that market similar configuration denon onkyo yamaha and harman kardon sell they at price between 250750 i buy the sharp for 99 tax for realom bh the item available in the comparable range sony phillips or rca either do not have the full configuration match or come with terrible review i be not consider boomboxe or the le know brand one obvious question be how good would be the sound quality straight out of the box the system be a stunner everything a advertised and work a design with only the minimal setup require the sound be surprisingly good very powerful powerful and rich once you set up i feel the midrange may be overpower with a tendency to muffle the high and fuzz out the low bass at a later date i might replace the two way speaker include with upgrade three way and also add a powered sub but for now the sound work the bluetooth work really well with a one time pair that sustain really optimize usage of stream audio for realom spotify and youtube my favorite the remote be efficiently design and allow full functionality i love be able to control bass and treble i find the good sound with treble at max and bass set to 0 thru 2 am fm reception be great with the attached antenna and the preprogram work very well a tuning scanner would have be great a would ve be swi and ii all in all it an absolute find and i be glad to be able to purchase it update march 2 9 month down stoday i learnedl love it i have it pair with my technics sl1950 turntable via a dj preii phono preamp the sound quality be great i be probably not an audiophile couldntwouldnt like to spend the qualification amount require to enroll in that club but i can tell you honestly that this set up meet my requirement of be able to listen to my jazz and classic rock record admirably it bring out the full depth of those old mile davis shin real lifeey horn coltrane and monk album a well a led zepp and hendrix the bluetooth work a wonder with spotify especially with my playlist of indian classical and film music just a well the volume do not go crazy high minor issue and probably good since i live in an ny apartment it do fill the apartment with beautiful undistorted sound a the speaker burn in they have become warm the tone lack very deep bass and i think a subwoofer would help i will perhaps replace the speaker though the thought seem like a wasteful luxury let u see add a couple of pic update june 10 2017 stoday i learnedl work great and i maintain my high esteem for the sharp xlf102b use it over the month i come to the conclusion that the amp be not output enough power to do justice to the speaker hence the tendency to slight muffling of the high and low a an experiment i purchase an oneu amplifier the 2 x 45watt and 1x68w sub sell a oneu but the actual amp i receive have lepy branding and line it for realom the speaker out connect the actual speaker to the amp speaker out it work like a charm not only can i back up volume to almost double the decibel without distortion i actually get way more definition and clarity in the high and midrange stoday i learnedl need the powered subwoofer though but i play sonny rollins kenny burrell on los and sound great i be now listen to led zeppellin on spotify and it a pretty respectable volume and amazing clarity between the sharp and the oneu by fiddle with volume and tone i can almost totally eliminate distortion and yet listen to my music loud enough to fill my apartment one con the sharp seem to reset it volume when one turn it up to 27 it automatically reset to 19 and then one have to increase it again do not reset after that thankfully must be the designer way of safeguard my hearing but i do not really need it thank jan 27 2018 add picture of the back and for realont of my setup a the product description do not show the reverse side the two little box for realom the top down be 1 dj pre ii phono preamplified 2 the oneu lepy amplifier 3 the low box be the sharp apology for the blurry pic but you can make out the sub pre out i be not output the speaker to the lepy anymore i be use the headphone out in the for realont see last pic it seem to work a well hope this help sound great stoday i learnedl have not buy a subwoofer but do not think i need one anymore the bass be pretty punchy especially when listen to real low cello and contrabassoon note classical,Good
serious review pun intend this fan beat any dyson fan out of the park who be i kid it a nice portable fan for your pc laptop medium device or whatever you want to use a usb fan for it pretty quiet and do not run hot quality be wellmade and definitely hold it pose it do not bend a much a you want it to but you would not want to break it bend it too much and the blade will start hit the cable keep in mind that the cable be short and it a usb portable fan that mean it do not produce strong wind and you can only use it a far a it connected output too long did not read summary list usb portable fan for your everyday electronic use quality be wellmade and will not likely break any time soon create a nice breeze keyword here be breeze look it up it bend but kind of short could break if bent too much i m talk about the fan,Good
this cable holder be compact and heavy and do a pretty good job at hold cable it 3 x 2 and the hole will hold anything thick than 38 the reason i give this cordie cable holder a 4 star rating be because of the deceptive picture that show it hold a lightning cable the typical lightning cable be 14 at the thick point and will fall through the cable holder since micro usb cable be not a uniform i try several different one and they hold up well the top opening be quite flexible allow you to easily push down cord through it the cordie cable holder be heavy enough to be able to hold up quite a few cable the bottom be also rubber so it have some antislipping property if you use cable saver on your lightning cable then you ll be able to use it with this cable holder i receive this product at a discount price to evaluate and provide an unbiased review,Good

the nexus 5x do not come with a usb a to usb c cable for datum transfer and if you re like most smartphone shopper you do not already have one i upgrade for realom a phone that use micro usb cable so i have a ton of those around the house along with a micro usb car charger what these adapter do be enable you to use your hoard of micro usb cable for your new usb c phone probably a cheap proposition than replace all of your exist chargerscable all at once i have test both item that come in the 2 pack and both work for charge and datum transfer charging be notably slow than it be on the charger that the 5x come with but that s not because of the adapter it because of my old charger other pro to this product be they be cheap the connection be very tight on the micro usb side and mostly tight on the phone side the housing be small so my case do not interfere with insertion you stoday i learnedl get to keep your micro usb cablescharger at hand in case you or your guest have micro usb device to charge a well overall so far i see no down side eventually i may upgrade to all fast charger and new usb c 31 cable but for right now this product allow i to salvage most of my investment in old micro usb charger,Good

with the plethora of usb power device nowadays it just make sense to have access to more port to charge everything phone tablet camera bluetooth speaker power bank etc this charger convert a single outlet into four high amp usb port capable of charge power hungry device like your ipad if you plug it into the bottom socket you also stoday i learnedl have room for another appliance in the top socket i test this by charge a tablet power bank iphone and an android phone simultaneously and it give maximum juice to all of they when plug in you ll see a subtle blue light to let you know it ready to go i ve have good luck with iclever product in the past so i m sure this will give i lot of good use a well i receive a complimentary unit for review purpose and my unbiased opinion be give above,Good

i m a computer repair technician and one issue i have all the time with my customer be the famous a virus hijack my computer and those precious picture be inside yeah the prom the honeymoon or the newborn picture be usually hold without ransom most of the time we be deal with malware of some sort that affect the window operating system file but leave the datum intact so before i repair the computer i rescue the picture and any other file they might value however not all repair technician do this most allege that the file be corrupt which might be the case but usually it really mean they be too busy to rescue anything do not know how to do it or will not do it unless pay big cash for one own sake the good thing to do be back up the datum before the computer get infect or the hard drive fail for picture i recommend back up the original file into datum disc but for fast everyday file backup music movie game software etc be well to use an external hard drive the western digital my passport 2 tb be an awesome way to carry large amount of datum in a tiny container that be always available and secure i love it dimension both physically and in byte also the truly fast datum transfer do with the usb 30 interface save time every day speak of the usb connector another great feature be that only require a single usb port for power while many external hard drive and enclosure with form factor 25 require two usb port this drive be great not only to keep multimedia file but also for store document in digital form because it save space besides in case of an emergency it fast to grab it then a folder i ve be do backup use both hard drive and disc and it have be of great help throughout the year for example the last time i move the new school district want my daughter first vaccine record i know i have the original card somewhere in a box but i need it fast then i remember i scan the card year ago and that printscanne image which be storage in my daughter digital folder inside my external hard drive save i hour of search and quicken her registering process at the new school about the wd smartware software offer by the manufacturer i hesitate before go for it because in the past wd back up software do not work well for i however when one be deal with such a big amount of datum do it manually be a pain and the alternative of use the backup and restore feature include in microsoft window 7 be something i would only do for a complete system image not for the everyday backup so i instal the wd smartware software and so far it perform well it do require time and attention to learn it functionality though if you decide not to use the wd smartware you can stoday i learnedl use the hard drive right out of the box like any other external hard drive besides read the user manual i strongly suggest that before plug in the drive into your computer you go to the western digital my passport support page and read how to use it because there be a few detail to know before start back up your datum among these topic how to install wd smartware for realom the external drive how to create a category backup use wd smartware how to backup specific file and folder use wd smartware how to retrieve a backup use wd smartware set up security to lock or unlock a wd external drive with wd smartware video be provide in some of these and how to partition and format a wd drive on window 7 vista xp and mac osx etc etc i can not post link here but one can do a search for wd support download my passport and will find the page where a variety of software that work with the western digital my passport 2 tb can be download for for realee however the most important fact of read western digitals support information for this drive be to learn how to use it before entrust your valuable datum to it specially if you choose to install the wd smartware software there be very important step everybody should know while set up these drive so it clearly state on the western digitals support page for example while instal the software it will ask if you want to apply any security password encryption to the drive before set up the password you must check an i understand box certify that you understand that if you forget the password the datum be unrecoverable i repeat and excuse the capital but this be crucial if you forget the password the datum be unrecoverable since there be no way to retrieve your password if you forget it please write that password in a secure available location if you want it possible to change your security setting remove security orand change the password but in order to do either you stoday i learnedl need the original password enter the first time if you forget your password you will not be able to access the data storage in the hard drive but you can continue to use the drive again if you format it of course the process of reformatte the hard drive will erase all the datum inside the unit and remove the password i highly recommend the western digital my passport 2 tb external hard drive i do have an warning though the only prove and trust way to preserve important file be to burn they into datum disc cddvdblurays because hard drive have a limited lifespan and will fail soon or later usually without any warning sign an external hard drive be very convenient to use but the stuff that can not be easily replace should always first be back up on disc trust i it will give you peace of mind also you can have two different hard drive with the same information like i do if you really do not want to keep disc around anymore,Good
bos bv7948b bluetooth i have have this bos bv7948b bluetooth receiver since 02222013 okay i be hesitant to buy this unit after read so much mixed review there be not many review online also so i promise myself that when i get this unit i will do a thorough review i buy the unit online for realom a store where i can go to the store to return it if i have to that way i do not have to ship it back my only 2 must criterion when buy a stereo receiver be that 1 it must have bluetooth hand for realee link where i can make and receive phone call 2 can stream bluetooth music for realom my iphone 4 to the stereo so i do not have to do any wired hookup i have instal many car stereo in my life time about 20 unit here be my take on this unit one thing to note be that the remote be about the size of my iphone4 and about half a thin screen be about a big a an iphone 4 screen pro dvd player look good not use much a the screen be too small for back seat viewer it have option to allow i output to a screen for my user in the back if i want to i have not use this option yet option to allow video input for reverse camera i add a camera and it look good bluetooth hand for realee link for make and receive phone call be fain real lifey good the mic be about 3 foot for realom i near my knee because the unit be sit low for my install user on the other line can hear okay sometime i have to talk in a slightly loud tone because the mic be not directly in for realont of i bluetooth music stream for realom my phone to the stereo this work great the name of the music do not display on the screen but that s ok for i greatest bang for the buck have lot of bell and whistle 2 usb input i do not use this much but have confirm that it work you can only use one usb at a time usb will not play music for realom iphone because it do not see the iphone a an external hard drive sd card loading be fast about 510 sec for 2 gb card size i do not try other size card because i do not have a large size con blue light on the key be way too bright if you look at it for too long you will see star you can see this for realom my picture i will post no dimmer on the unit build in amp and equalizer be no good not a good a your top of the line brand sound quality be okay could be well custom equalizer user can only adjust the terrible and the bass no mid sometime when you turn on the car the unit do not come on automatically have to press the source power to turn it on but some time it come on just fine unit have to re load the sd card when you switch for realom one source then back to the sd source mode but the loading be fain real lifey quick sd mode sometime do not go to the song where you leave off when you turn the car back on and off blue screen of death back ground be on aux input only this must be the late revise model i hear other complain about it be on the radio source screen not in my case see my picture the navigation on this unit be a little clunky so you will want to we the remote a much a you can for example if you want to select something on the screen you have to press and hold the band key this will put you in the shift mode and then you can then scroll the volume button to select the item you want press the scroll button in to make the final selection direction be not a helpful gloss screen make it hard to view the display due to the glare this be annoying summery this unit be a keeper the con be not enough for i to uninstall and return the unit this be by far the great bang for the buck only time can tell how long the unit will last i,Good
i also have several of the kingston data traveler which be similar construction but very slow one thing i do not like about the samsung be the design of the loop the loop be useful for pull the drive out of a usb slot but it add unnecessary bulk when on a key chain and can only be instal one way unlike the kingston drive which be the same thickness for realom end to end and lie flat alongside your key one area of concern be how the flash memory be actually attach to the steel sleeve if it anything like the kingston they re probably glue in which make it possible for they to eventual fall out for realom jar shake drop etc might want to encrypt your datum if you store anything of any value on it,Good
for year i use the traditional wacom tablet start for realom the bamboo move up to an intuos 2 then finally the intuos 5 i m an illustrator who look directly at what i be draw so it be always awkward for i to simply draw with the tablet and could not afford the price of entry for the cintiq last summer i give in and order this cintiq alternative and i be so very glad i do some detail below for those look to know about any quirk and how it run with software response time be pretty good occasionally when blend a lot of color or do some crazy fast crosshatch it may need a second or two to catch up but not a deal breaker use in a duel monitor setup work perfect when the driver be work with window 10 more on that later work amazing in manga studio clip studio paint adobe light room and illustrator cc however have many brush issue when try to digitally paint in photoshop cc i may just need to update photohop to fix this though screen be very reflective and can be a little distracting especially if you have a light on right about you see attach photo of ceiling fan light reflection since you do not have the gesture like in the intuous 5 and the cintiqs recommend something like the shuttleexpress to help with screen rotation brush size increase etc to speed up your workflow warning for win 10 user it work perfect when you chase down the new working driver because window 10 auto update every few month the update will delete the driver if you find your tablet be not respond to the pen at all check the hidden icon section on your start menu task bar and if your tablet driver be no long there it time to go to the yinova or panda city website and see if there be a new driver and reinstall it i just get his by this before i mean to work on a client piece so while i m download the driver want to write this review hope it help some of you update 862018 in the spring the brightness would flicker on and off a would the red in the monitor eventually the monitor would not even show a picture send it into pandacity who service the unit great customer service and very fast turn around however my monitor be flicker again and often win10 be not recognize the usb cord in the monitor half the time it boot up suffice to say this be go back in for another repair overall despite this issue it hold up to year of daily use and stoday i learnedl feel a though it worth the purchase but just be aware you might run into kink after two year of daily usage,Good

this little guy be a pretty amazing item firstly it extremely retro which be pretty cool it offer a three port usb hub and the ability to plug in an external hard drive which can be use for backup i like the design because it appear they be able to encompass it all make it pretty unique the only reason i give this product 3 star be because i m unable to get the backup feature to work on mac i already have an external drive but i would have love to use this one a expand memory on that note the thing come with a cd which be strange because most laptop be do away with cdrom drive in fact i can not recall the last time i have one so while a desktop might work with those driver you ll be hardpresse to find a laptop that can will i use a macbook pro a my desktop so i be somewhat screw moreover this unit be clearly design to be use at a desk i repeat this be not something you would carry around with you wherever you go if you want to do that get one that have usb supply power i ve take a moment to go over my pro and con pro look amazing have an onoff switch have dedicate power cord bad for some do accept sata drive little slow than ssd include three additional usb port 30 speed appear to have some sort of warranty cost effecient con make design produce in china although quality do not seem very bad small but to bulky to really carry around with you dedicated power good for some pretty noisey but i be use it without the include sata cover so that may be why requires you have a cdrom big issue here while everything be in the box it be all in another language china japan possibly country of origin while i do receive this product for for realee or at a discount for an honest and unbiased review have i not i would not have purchase this base on my review today i would not purchase this item again if i need something similar,Average
impressively transparent and punchy sound for realom this tiny little amplifier so far after a few hour of use at the upper end of it power output i can report very little heat buildup and most important that the sound reproduction be very clean easily power my old set of klipsch bookshelf speaker i have be quite impressed with the stereo separation dynamic and overall clarity of sound mimic performance of a much more expensive amplifier these mini classd amp be ideal for a conceal installation and once i have a few more week of use i plan to velcro mount inside my medium cabinet which will stoday i learnedl permit access to the large volume knob and power switch so much sound quality value for a nominal cost edit have to dock 1 star after live with the horrid loud poweron announcement it a bit obnoxious and unnecessary i have to power off on because i get a audible hum when 18 cable be plug in will a device ipod phone hook up,Good
i do a quick informal comparison of aftermarket battery for realom wasabi powernewmowa and the oem battery that ship with the xiaomi yi action camera too long do not read the short version wasabi power perform a good a the oem and i highly recommend newmowa be blatantly lie about the 1200mah capacity and perform poor of the option i would avoid they in favor of wasabi power both brand be manufacture to fit in the international version of the camera the usa version of the camera the one i have appear to have a different battery compartment and the battery require a bit of cardboard or foam spacer to be fully compatible with the usa version of the camera see pic the fix be very quick and easy to do and i stoday i learnedl recommend these battery for the u version see detail below the test be a continuous video recording at 1080p 30fps wifi off static indoor scene with no movement each test be run twice and average result oem rate 990mah 1 hour 47 minute wasabi rate at 1010mah 1 hour 46 minute newmowa rate at 1200mah 1 hour 36 minute i be surprise by the difference between wasabi and newmowa because the two battery physically look like they come for realom the same factory obviously the 1200mah be standard aftermarket battery capacity exaggeration although the newmowa stoday i learnedl perform well enough i d pick the wasabi to buy again if the price be the same due to the long run time also it too soon to tell but assume the newmowa be use inferior battery cell it also stand to reason that they will wear our and need to be replace soon a well i will update this review and low my star rating if that prove to be the case very important note about battery size and fit i have the u version of the camera it appear that the u version have a different back door or battery compartment design the oem battery for the u version be thick than the oem for the international version both the battery for realom wasabi and newmowa be sized for the international version and be substanthanks in advancelly thin than the battery for the u camera if you have the u version of the camera these battery must be modified slightly before you can use they in your camera without glue a small spacer onto the battery see photo a mild tap on the camera will cause the battery to slide around and disengage the contact turn off the camera and lose your video not good for an action camera but the fix be very easy with a tiny spacer glue in i ve never have a problem it a quick 1minute fix that work perfectly you can use any material foam cardboard paper whatever be handy the spacer do not have to cover the entire battery only the part close to the contact see photo it very easy to modify these battery to work in the u camera version and they today i learnedl get 5 star for realom i i recommend take the 5 second to glue the spacer into place because it make quick battery change much easy nothing to fall out get lose fumble etc note that in the photo the oem battery have a slight rounded curve to it on the downward edge i do not know why this be because my camera housing be perfectly square both the dualbay charger appear to be identical and function the same a note on the usb charger i highly recommend that you plug they into a usb 30 port or a 2 amp wall charger use a standard 500ma wall charger or a usb 20 port there s just not enough current to effectively charge both battery more like a trickle charge remember it not the charger fault it will only function a good a the power source you plug it into,Good

if you need extra usb port for your desktop this be the adapter card for you but there be one down side to this card it run noticeably hot i do not actually measure this but base on the heat i felt come off the card i imagine it around the 7080c range you may also notice that some of the lower rate review write tail of this card burn out or catch fire however i decide to take a chance with this and try it anyways and i can say it work the way i need to but i take some safety precaution with it in the product link below i purchase some paint aluminum heat sink they be selfadhere and adhere good when the computer be on and the card be run hot be careful though they bond to the card almost instantly so make sure you be set they down how you want they akust aluminum memory chip heatsink 079x031x019 inch blue 16 pc after apply these heat sink the card be much much much cool to the touch i would say around the 4050c zone be my good estimate i have attach picture to show how i lay these out so if you be concerned with this card overheat i would say order some of the heatsink i link to protect the lifespan of this adapter card update 3292017 after use this card for a little over a month now i notice something particularly unusual with this card the card work just fine readingwriting datum use peripheral using power hungry peripheral but there be one oddity that stand out on this card when try to image a usb storage device with it the preformace almost come to a halt for some reason the card simply will not preform when imaging usb mount storage it read and write normal datum for realom usb storage flawlessly but simply come to a stand stoday i learnedl when do imaging operation,Good

the metal case be awesomebutafter use it for some time a few of the port just stop work the power plug finally become so loose a to be unusable into the garbage it go too bad the innard be not a awesome a the case i would probably give this 5 star if the power adapter connector be well quality it very cheap and eventually require a workaround to keep the connector in contact with the internal receptacle to maintain power i set up a hook pile strip contraption that apply a constant upward pull on the plug to keep it work i do not really trust the manufacturer to fix the problem but with the hook pile in place it work like a champ the usb connector be much well than most use a usb 30 atypeusb 30 btype cable which provide a very good connection unlike some that use the usb 30 atypeusb 30 micro b cable which be a disaster wait to happen,Bad
the iclever himbox replace a belkin aircast i ve have instal in my car for the past three year the belkin stoday i learnedl work fine however after read the spec for realom wirecutters blog and see the price be decent enough i decide to give it a try reason why i d buy another bluetooth device when my current one work fine be a follow automatic connection to my iphone upon start the car belkin have to press button to connect volume and track control on the device itself none on belkin a crisper voice sound due to the late bluetooth technology and finally link with siri just by hold the main button the mic on the himbox seem to pick up my voice well than aircast and thus i be able to move the device to the center console by the shifter which make it easy to reach with my hand instead of have to reach out to the dash while drive if i remember ill post pic the only reason i deduct a star i normally turn my key to intermediate for like 4 second before turn it fully on to get the electrical go and prime the system some old school trick i ve do with different car for decade except when i do this with the himbox it start flash and do not connect to my iphone if i turn and start the ignition straight away with no pause it not a problem and announce it connect right away,Good
the construction of this cable feel well build when you hold it in your hand it do not feel cheap and flimsy like other charge cable do the braid casing be a nice feature because it feel good to the touch the wire feel like a thick gage although i do not know the actual spec i be only refer to feel it great for lie in bed or on the couch because the length give you the for realeedom of movement that most cable do not if i destroy this cable i would buy another one rather than search out a new brand,Good

with a native resolution around 720p with 1080p upscale the picture on this despite the same native resolution be well than the resolution on my other projector that be about 80 and be mini i find adjustment for focus to be a bit odd a if you adjust untoday i learned the projector menu screen be in focus it not the same a focus for the picture of the medium be display i be able to get a pretty sharp picture with just the focus wheel though there be two hdirect messagei input and switching between input be a breeze with or without the include remote control i have so far hook up a roku and also my iphone use a lightning to hdirect messagei adapter and have tobeexpecte result my only real complaint thus far be that this projector do not have a standard screw hole for a mount or tripod so you ll either have to improvise if attempt to mount this or make sure there be a hard flat surface to set it on top of i just use a tv dinner tray there be a leg on the bottom that seem wonky at first but when you figure out how to use it it be actually quite nifty you lift up the projector and point it at the wall exactly where you need it and then just push the button on the for realont and the leg pop up a far a it need to be to hold that position the keystone adjustment on this projector give you a good amount of leeway but it should be note that you ll likely want to have this at least 34 ft off the ground in any case depend on how high up you need the picture because the adjustment be pretty much maxe out if you go much low try to shoot a picture 3 ft off the ground on a wall the remote feel like good quality in your hand and be not super complicate which be great for quick easy use the volume on this projector get really loud but i have to say that the sound quality be absolutely a standard mono experience the fan be quiet enough on the projector that it not disruptive but my small mini projector be actually more quiet than this one i like the hard cover lens protector that it come with assures i that it be well protect when not in use the projector come with a power cord very stiffthick hdirect messagei cable the remote control 2 aaa battery be not include and a component rca to aux adapter overall i ve be rather impressed with the picture quality and operation of this projector enough that i be retire the old one and may gift it to family hopefully the photo include do it justice we be fortunate enough to have a finished basement that can cut out a lot of sunlight at just about any time of the day the price on this be a bit high i feel but we will be give it a good beating so hopefully the price be indicative of the life and quality compare to my much cheap projector,Good

great sound and mic performance much well than my old logitech headset i be use i primarily use this headset for skype and podcasting on my imac sound be very natural which be great for voipskypegame mic be too on my old logitech headset when i record a podcast my voice sound very tinny and with these plantronics be sound much more natural and warm the sound be good enough to use these a general headphone for music too decent bass and clear midshigh very surprising and a welcome surprise at that some reviewer complain that these be too loud and i do not find that to be the case at all at least on the mac the volume depend on your system volume level and the volume control on the side of the headset control the system audio so not too loud for i i mean the do get loud but nothing horribly terrible comfort be pretty good the ear cup completely cover my ear but depend on ear size they may or may not cover your when podcast i ve wear these for an hour straight with no problem with comfort whatsoever they stay put too if you shake your head they stay on which i like a lot i do buy a windscreen piece for the mic tip too which i recommend plantronics windscreen kit supra ncpolarisnoise cancelling mouth piece a far a setup it just plug n play with my mac no driver need very happy with this headset and the quality of the sound highly recommend,Good
awesome charger this 4 port charger could not get much small a each side of the cube be only a large a require to fit the 4 usb port i ve include photo to compare the the size to a standard post it note a well a to the comparable 2 port charger a huge advantage this charger have over a lot of other model be the width of the cube and the orientation position of the plug a show in photo this charger can fit between two standard plug on a power strip it can also be plug into a standard duplex outlet without interfere with the other plug these two point make it a great candidate for both more permanent office use a well a for road warrior who find themselves share outlet at the airport i mention this in my review of the 2 port charger but ill say it againthe blue lead indicator be a great addition the usefulness be twofoldthe led confirm power to the device and help you find available usb port in the dark my only recommendation would be to include a second one to well light the bottom two port charge be fast the only well option be oem quick charger specific to your device the fact that there be 24adedicate to each port regardless of how many device be charge be a huge advantage over many other charger cheaper model for realom other manufacturer will be 24a for every 2 port or even 1 amp for every 2 port unfortunately i do not have a usb multimeter but all of my charge speed be consistent with other 24a charger i have the only device i have a problem charge be a jawbone up2 i believe this be more the fault of jawbone and their lack of compatibility with the smartid charge standard a it tend to dislike charge via anything other than a computer mount usb port it work great with io device via lightning cable the new nexus 6p via usbc and old android phone use micro usb all in all this charger be ideal for anyone with a need to charge more than two device the design be well think out the form factor be great for travel and it work a advertise desire the few aforementione small improvement would be nice finish touch but at that point i m really be nitpicky disclosure i receive this device in exchange for an honest imparthanks in advancel review i do however purchase the similar twoport model for realom iclever iclever boostcube 48a 24w dual usb travel wall charger with smartid technology foldable plug for iphone ipad samsung galaxy htc nexus moto blackberry bluetooth speaker headset power bank white myself and be similarly impressed with that product,Good
fast card i have super compatible work even with adapter see test performance this 633x card be rate at 95mbsec read speed class 10 and it pretty much deliver on that promise use crystaldiskmark 3 and the supply usb3 adapter i measure 85 mbsec lexar do admit that write speed will be low and indeed they be at 41 mbsec for comparison a sandisk ultra class 10 card i have sandisk ultra 16 gb microsdhc class 10 uhs1 memory card with adapter sdsdqu016gaffpa test 44 mb read and 11 mb write in that same usb3 adapter the lexar be about twice a fast a sandisk ultra note that both card drop dramatically in speed when use in a usb2 adapter when use in a usb2 reader they be both very similar at 10mbsec write and 17mbsec read speed so it may be device that you will be use it in that will be the limit factor rather than the brand of card certainly once you record a huge video file on this card i would use the supply usb3 adapter to transfer it to the computer a you may save over three minute in download time alone compatibility i use the card in a gopro 3 silver at 1080p 60 fps without any glitch or problem no error no for realeeze up since i also have a sd card adapter i insert the lexar into it and the whole setup go inside a fuji xp camera see photo i be not sure it would work but it do just fine so with this one micro sdhc card you can use it in phone video device and old camera that use full size sd card a well bonus the supply micro sd usb3 reader work perfectly with other micro card such a the sandisk ultra class 10 card more than double it read to computer speed and also with an old kingston class 4 micro sdhc card also increase it read to computer speed by 50,Good

pro 1 the led will get blindingly bright i have no idea why anyone would want that but it nice that the option be there 2 go to a mechanical keyboard for realom a membrane be even well than you probably be imagine 3 the top plate design be beautiful brush aluminum and look great despite the plastic bottom 4 a volume roller be such a well design than volume button 5 the computer software be not a difficult to figure out a all the review say it have some serious short coming in allow you to truly configure the keyboard but it be easy to use the functionality that be build into it 6 the key font be great and the main character light up uniformly on all but the low brightness setting the shift character indicator do light up poorly though 7 it feel very quality when type not so much when scroll the volume con there be too many for a keyboard of this price 1 the key on be upside down and they be not symmetrical so they look bad when flip since the switch have the led at the top they put the main character at the top and the shift character at the bottom this be as backwards for realom every other keyboard look at your keyboard see how the sign be on bottom and the be on top that will be reverse to piss you off 2 the bottom row of key be not contour they have a sharp bottom edge even membrane keyboard figure out long ago that you round off the bottom row so a not to make a sharp angle where the thumb engage the space bar this keyboard do not so the space bar feel terribly unergonomic you will see that to fix this many be flip the spacebar upside down picture but then your new spacebar on your 100 keyboard do not light up this design be garbage but you may say this be so the keyboard can use standard replacement key which bring i to my next point 4 the key be a nonstandard size so you will not easily replace they this be a very minor negative since i would never replace the key if they have just design the spacebar well but it suck since that spacebar be so bad 5 the chassis be not aluminum the top plate be and that s great but for 100 the backplate would have be great in aluminum too 6 the volume scroller feel like garbage it be stoday i learnedl decent because the material be nice knurled aluminum and a roller for volume be genius but there be no resistance when turn it so it end up feel like a very cheap button next to all of your expensive custom mechanical key 7 my least favorite part of the design be the palm rest it be attach by very cheap and breakable plastic connector furthermore if you pick up the keyboard it flop down if you leave it on a desk then you probably will not care but if you be use it in an environment where it be pas around like in a home theater then it suck i fix this by fill the back with a black latex caulk picture that will easily peel out if i need to warranty it this make the palm rest rigid while stoday i learnedl allow a very little bit of rubber bush like flex it feel way well than the garbage design it come with 8 you can not truly set up your brightness setting well the light button on the keyboard have only simple function no matter what you do it multiply your light set the brightness in the computer program can be set 0255 in value but the hardware key 3 position be not configurable at all let i explain let u say you pick a value of 10 a your low setting for a nighttime environment well the hardware button will only make 10 20 and 30 brightness which be stoday i learnedl not very bright so you will not have a good bright set the fully configurable talk be a total lie you can not have a very dim setting and a very bright setting on this keyboard you can only compromise between the two unless you go into the computer software every time to change it you can also not have a solid key color and then a custom pattern by press the keyboard switch you can only dim whatever patern you be use unless you back into the software this be a major downfall 9 the cap lock scroll lock and num lock key be bright white no matter which color led you choose and they do not dim so they be an annoyance at night time when you be use a dim set 10 the mute button do not light up to show the mute be on this would have be a cheap and very convenient feature summary overall it be a very good feeling keyboard with a good selection of switch and lead color preference but the lighting configuration kind of suck consider that this be a main selling point the plastic attachment of the palm rest be a garbage feature of an 18 thick aluminum top keyboard it be inexcusable to use nondimme white led on a keyboard where the customer specify and pay for red or blue led many people be take their new keyboard apart to replace they and then they lose their warranty,Average

add a few photo that be recent for anyone who have question about the hyper evo 212 it do fit with at least an inch maybe half inch gap for the most part it be a great case besides a few major problem i love this style and size of this case but the bad part be when instal the motherboard when you screw in the gold screw most of they do not tighten they just keep spin and then when you put the motherboard on you can screw it in major pain in the as which i m sure they re all like that because i ve buy one previously like this second major issue be they do not give you enough space where the psu go so if you have a full modular good luck i spend an hour and a half deal with it and get the wire through the hdd cage i think if your psu be non modular then you re way well off other than that case be great stoday i learnedl wait to put some lighting in it,Bad

here the good and the bad of this board recently have to upgrade my system to i7 core asus z97a board 960 gb ocz ssd for program and app old system i5 pentium core asus p8 z77vlx board 512 kingston solid state drive both system hadhave 1 tb western digital7200 hd for datum storage and management window 7 o pro diligently maintainedupdate and 16 gb of ram corsair ddr3 1600 hz 4x4 gb the good about asus z97 motherboard compare to p8z77 two usb 31 port these turn out to actually provide fast datum transfer than 30see below six sata 6 gb s connector should theoretically make most basic function eg boot the computer fast but they do not see below more fan connector than my old asus ez p switch a switch that allow user to get the maximum function of your ram tpu switch that should theoretically allow you to overclock your system with two switch setting epu switch that should theoretically allow user to intelligently customize power flow to various component and especially the cpu thus prevent overheat theoretically see below if you be into high end gaming or you like to play with your bios setting by for instance change they every 5 minute this be a perfect thing for you if on the other hand you be like the 99 of normal pc user email net surfing photo edit music video without high end edit etc my advice save you money the bad oh where do i start where do i start well let start with the hardware whoever be in charge of this new generation of asus product forget a few simple thing most be relatively small but screw they up be so annoying for example this board have no mobo speaker speaker be that little thing that go beep to let you know that all the component have past the post test or a series of beepbeepbeeps that let you know that something be off the manual make several reference to do something after the post but how the heck be the user suppose to know that the post test be do if there be no speaker or if something be wrong how do we know what it be there be no visual digital error indicator either something that be be use by many other manufacturer to let the user know that something in the board set up be not right put tpu and epu switch on the board may sound like a good idea untoday i learned you try to figure out what be the good configuration for you search google what should i set my tpu and epu switch to will illustrate the amount of confusion in geekoverse the answer be no one know even the asus website have nothing definitive to help you out i ve set both of mine to off just in case have two slot for usb 31 again sound like a good idea untoday i learned you realize that the support documentation do not really explain that well what to do with they do i need a special cable i think the answer to that be no 30 cable seem to work fine do i need a special driver for this yes the driver be on a separate dvd that come with the motherboard and need to be instal on your hard drive for usb 31 to function if you can install it see below although usb 31 should theoretically double the transfer speed it do not here be the actual range of transfer speed on my computer usb 20 48 67 mb ave 62 usb 30 122 161 mb ave 148 usb 31 198 222 mb ave 202 and this bring i to the topic of sofor the winare that come with this fine piece of mmmmm piece of asus engineering caution make sure you back up all your datum and system configuration on a separate drive before instal any of asus sofor the winare if run window make sure you have a separate bootable repair disk a well my old asus motherboard p8z77 come with a quick and easytoinstall software package it contain asus suite ii utoday i learnedity that easily allow i to change bios setting without leave window or reboot the system notice how i say it be easy to install not this one not software for asus z97 insert software disk for asus z97 will bring you to the junkware tab it be their default first page with offer to install an outdated version of google chrome browser or a trial of norton antivirus there be no escape every time you reboot this will be your greeting for realom asus the user manual booklet that come with the board list the software on the disk but not what to do with it do i install driver first or should i proceed to install asus suite iii if i have asu suite ii on my computer for realom my old board do it need to be remove first what driver do i absolutely need feel for realee to contemplate these over and over and over warning some of the driver on support dvd will remove the driver already on your system so again make sure you back everything up before you start if use window make sure you at least create a restore point instead of give you an option to install multiple essenthanks in advancel driver all at once asus make you install they one at a time there be no indication of which be essenthanks in advancel and which be junk which of they be old than the one you already may have and which be new the disk software will try to install they regardless of what be on your drive most if not all require a system reboot be aware that in addition to driver utoday i learnedity and junkware the disk you be use be a bootable disk this will slow the restart process immensely a the system will ask you each time which drive do you wish to boot for realom since not each driver installation proceed flawlessly by the end of the first night i count 28 twenty eight reboot that i need to do just to install some of the software and to add insult to injury after all that the main application asus suite iii refuse to work i try delete asus suite ii an old version then reinstall the current one suite iii but be hit with so many error message that i finally give up and proceed to attempt to restore system to an old restore point eventually this fail too and i have to restore windowsdata for realom a current backup faulty driver and uninstallable asus suite iii be not the only problem the software seem to be riddle with bug one of the utoday i learnedity program be call intel startup it be suppose to speed up the boot process sound good right that s what i think and proceed to try to install it the error message i get this time be that this option be available for system run for realom a solid state drive ssd only and be not appropriate for my computer but but but i think to myself my computer be run off an ssd it be it be honestly but who be i to argue with asus software by the way about start the system the boot time i have with my old system asus p8z77 be 24 second measure for realom release of the on button to the end of window welcome screen boot time with the current system asus z97 be 52 second i measure the boot time use same o and ram chip also i do the test before switch to the new ssd i doubt that pentium i7 fast chip than my previous i5 be the because of slow boot time and the last thing in some instance the include software fails to run bios function in a way that it be suppose to one of the feature for instance be the ability to selectively turn on and off the fan on the motherboard yep you guess it this do not work but what be the last straw for i what peak my for realustration level to the point of scream at 4 am be when i receive a warning on my desktop that there be something wrong with the motherboard temperature it say warning sensor1 300o celsius now i know that there be someone at asus some engineer perhaps who understand thermodynamic i hope asus realize the magnitude of what they have discover here reach the temperature of minus 300o celsius would mean either that a the law of the universe have suddenly change and engineer at asus be up for the next nobel prize in physic or b this be the dumbest sofor the winare asus have create to date oh well at least they report the temperature warning in metric unit i be so impressed i save the screenshot it take i a few hour to upgrade the hardware by comparison i be on my second day of try to make the software work while try not to keel over for realom fatigue and for realustration last night i stay up today i learnedl after 4 in the morning i wonder if the person who come up with this particular software package be lobotomize in childhood do it hurt what a miracle of modern medicine it be that one can undergo a lobotomy and stoday i learnedl work a a software developer for asus anyway if you be read this review while consider which motherboard to buy may i recommend something else anything else will probably be le for realustrating if you have already buy this and be try to figure out how to make it work i wish you good luck i really and most sincerely do,Bad
just to get the require stuff out of the way i be provide this cable for realee of charge in exchange for my review if you look over my other review you will see i truly give unbiased reviewsso much so that zerolemon cut i off after i leave a le than stellar review of one of their iphone 6 case on to what matter i really like this cable i have about 7 different lightning cable for realom vary manufacturer some which i purchase and some provide to i for review so i feel like i have a good basis of comparison when i say i love this cable it be a good a my prior favorite if not well because of the braiding pro it mfi certify obviously the product description state that but i be able to verify it with apple personally these cable be manufacture by a large chinese company yellowknife httpwwwglobalsourcescomsiasyellowknifecable6008839927814homepagehtm httphdmicableenalibabacom which seem to specialize in generic cable for a wide variety of application include mobile device this be in no way a knock against the cable because this seem to come for realom a high end line than their other mobile accessory i believe this explain why it be sell under a different name a i have find that other high quality cable i like be also sell in the same manner a large asia base company sell under a few different perhaps more appealing to the u market name to brand their different product line i love braid cable because they feel so much nice and more tactoday i learnede than the rubbervinyl one there be a reason high end pc builder have be sheathe their internal cable with braid material for year i also find they tend to do well in long term durability i have two apple lightning cable with the white outer insulation crumble offi doubt i will experience such problem with this braid cable even with the braiding this cable be stoday i learnedl a flexible and practically a thin a my other high quality cable see my photo for comparison 10 ft seem like a ridiculous length but it honestly perfect i have a 6 ft amazon basic cable and it just seem a too short for when i be lay in bed with my phone 10 ft give i enough room to lay down comfortably and never feel like i be pull on the cord bonus i travel quite regularly so have the extra couple foot be really nice especially in airport and hotel most airport be get well at provide outlet but you do not want to be one of those weirdo sit on the floor just to use your phone stroll past those peasant and whip out your glorious 10 ft cable and sit down in a chair like a human being trust meits so choice it completely arbitrary but i like the space grey color i prefer thing to be coordinate and i hate how nasty the white apple cable get after a few month of use the grey be fain real lifey close to the space gray iphone 6 it not a perfect match but it close enough for my eye so that s a plus over black or white cable the lightning end of the cable be slightly small than some of the other after market cable i have use again see my photo for a side by side comparison i have no problem connect to my computer with this cable i import the entire photovideo library of my phone without a hitch some company claim fast transfer or charge speed which be for realankly bogus charge speed be control with the amperage supply by the plug adapter and i doubt the cable quality with usb will effect speed much on my windows10 pc i be able to download 1000 photo and video in a matter of minute i do not see any difference in the same test with my oem cable the price be just right at 15 dollar it be stoday i learnedl way cheap than any comparable oem cable and it the sample price a all it competitor con the only thing i can find to complain about be that the lightning end be slightly large than the oem cable this really only come into play with a few case where the large housing around the lightning end will prevent the connector for realom fitting with my speck case this be not a problem but some might have too small an opening around the lightning port for use with this cable i do not deduct a star because none of the after market cable i have be a small a the apple oem and so far this lax cable be just about the small i have not experience it yet but with heavy use cheaply braid cable can for realay if i begin to see this happen rest assure i will update this review summary overall i love this lax 10 ft braid lightning cable and it have replace my previous favorite zerolemon black 10 ft a my main cable for every day charge have several long cable around have become very convenient a i leave one in my main suitcase one in my car one in my backpack and one on my desk at work everywhere i go i have a cable to charge and sync so if i do not already have several i would purchase more of these cable to take with i everywhere,Good
i have no idea what happen it work fine and after plug it in today the light turn red but do not open i have 700 gb worth of music in this hard drive that i can not loose i blame myself for not back up the most but stoday i learnedl i do not expect it to go this early be there a way to recover anything in the drive i stoday i learnedl have it under warranty but i do not want to just replace it i need what be on it in the first place dec 2015 i now have 2 useless hd not worth the money or the time i go with the lacie thunderbolt hd beyond disapointed and let i be a lesson to someone who want to buy this hd,Bad
for the most part quality construction i need more than 6 outlet and multiple highcurrent usb charge port i do not see many other product that offer this the cord be heavy duty and the case be very solid the only concern be that the outlet do not hold the plug in very tightly especially on a couple plug that have slightly thin prong i have not notice any hum problem that some have report update the loose socket i previously mention be prove to be problematic some of the plug tend to work their way out over time i be concerned that the loose connection may produce heatresistance at the prong maybe this be a manufacture fault with just my unit since i have not hear anyone else complain about this i do email the company month ago and never receive a response bumping rating down to 3 i do not want to take a chance order another one so i have since replace this with another brand,Average
the ethernet chip onboard be a realtek rtl8152 and work out of the box on the raspberry pi 2pi zero although for the 5 pi zero you be spend 15 on it which would bring you to pib territory in term of cost and with a driver load a window 10 tablet lenovo miix 2 8 you should have no issue with android assume that your device maker compile ethernet support into the distribution most new one leave it out so make sure before you buy performance be great and actually run an usb2 speed so about 8 to 10 mbytessec the device do not come with a charger since it ll just pull off the device supply but you can easily pick one up a 5 or 10w wall wart unit will do just fine it can do power injection with the include cable your mileage may vary but mine come with it see the include photo below via the hub to charge the device see photo for pi zero and lenovo window tablet although that be say a good deal of device that i know of will not accept power this way so your mileage may vary overall decent construction work a advertise can not ask for more than that,Good

pro first up it fast despite the package tout only 130mbs it read at 150mbs which be just a fast a the sandisk ultra fit the write be considerably well than the sandisk 112 to 120mbs rather than 96100 the 4k read and write be a mixed bag depend on which benchmark i run crystal diskmark be not terribly impressed 5 read 17 write but both atto and flashbench get much well number like 24 read and 17 write which be small ssdlike performance but here where i be most impressed while the overheating problem these tiny drive have be not completely solve samsung make sure it do not actually break anything instead transfer speed will merely drop to almost nothing like 03mbs for one to two second while it catch it breath it do not disconnect and your transfer do not fail con it more expensive than the sandisk ultra fit now i see why the plastic part be white most machine be not i would not paint it for heat reason but vinyl dye would probably work well if you care that much summary for those look into a fit style drive that barely peek out of the usb port this be the one you want it be every bit a good a the sandisk ultra fit possibly well even where the sandisk be at it good and it be immensely well because it actually work at the thing that make the sandisk ultra fit fall over and choke give the way the performance scale with transfer size it seem a if the samsung fit be like a quarter of an ssd two chip instead of eight meaning 14 the bandwidth available however it squeeze everything it can out of those two compare the two chart attach one for the fit and one for my main drive which be an 840 evo and you ll see what i m get at,Good

this bestten all in one surge protector really be all in one it do everything and it do it all very well there be eight outlet to plug whatever you want in and it have surge protection to protect everything the outlet be space nicely so you can fit big block a well a regular plug in and not cover up an outlet due to a large sized block plug that be often part of electronic device there be five outlet on one side space closely and three on the other with plenty of space between for the block and big stuff i love that feature i always lose at least one outlet due to a block or oversized plug there be a phone jack and a network jack for an ethernet cable a well there be cable tv connector on this surge protector then there be two usb port and i can charge my note 5 with fast charging while my husband can charge his s5 with regular charge both port be fast and work great the six foot cord be super durable and heavy i appreciate the length i have have some surge protector with three foot cord and they be such a pain to situate the surge protector be mark with item that can or should be plug into each outlet like computer notebook etc but the outlet can be use for anything that you plug in the unit can be wall mount or set on the floor or a desk we have our centrally locate so that it be easily accessible to we we have be use this surge protector for several week and have have no problem at all i feel good know it be protect against surge because i just buy a new tv and of course my computer could be damage by surge we do not have a phone plug into the unit but we have use it for a fax machine we own we have since sell that but it nice know all those option be available to we when we need they this can be use strictly a an eight outlet surge protector but it have so many other use that it would be a shame not to get the most out of it it do not overheat and it work just fine even when it be load with thing plug into it i be very happy with this unit and i can not imagine go back to regular surge protector or strip i receive this product for for realee in exchange for my honest review i evaluate it for several week before write this review to be sure we would have no issue and we have not i be not affiliate with the seller and be not compensate for my review in fact i have have no contact at all with the seller since i agree to accept this product for review it excellent,Good
i buy this case on sale for 3199 i be very happy with what you get for what you pay this be a quality build case it might be slightly flimsy than some of the more expensive offering on the market but i feel a though it a solid enough product overall and be stoday i learnedl an excellent offering if you re look for a budget pc case that will not burn a hole in your wallet i will say that i m not particularly a fan of the optical drive bay and hdd bay be a solid part of the case i wish that they be in some way modifiable or removable i end up have to dremel a small section of the hdd bay to get clearance for my video card the other gripe i have be that cable management be really pretty awful there s not much space behind the mother board panel to run cable and when you do run your cable for realom your psu to your mobo the way that they re suppose to be route there be barely enough space to get the side panel back on it take a little bit of muscle and tweak to get the side panel back on correctly that s a minor annoyance though you will not likely get an interior build that s perfectly clean of wire with this case but if perfection be what you re look for then you should probably be look at a high price case to begin with ultimately for the price it an excellent little case and great for beginner such a myself to get into pc building,Good
cable matter seem to have change how they manufacture this cable at some point and you should be aware that the new cable be much fat than the old version which be a big problem if like i you be try to tuck it into a tight space i happen to be try to tuck it behind dash trim to install a dashcam see my customer photo for a comparison,Average
ill start off by say that i do not have high expectation whenever i order a product that s cheap and deliver for realom china but i expect they to try a little bit i order 2 of these for 540 a piece here be the issue i ve come across in the first few hour since receive the bluetooth receiver 1 hopefully you can see in the attach picture both device have an issue where the circuit board contain the usb contact do not sit correctly within the usb plug this can make it hard to plug in but with a little coax i be able to get both device to plug into a usb power source the device on the left be bad but be plug in overnight and appear to have correct itself 2 unfortunately the device on the left be doa when i receive it it do power up and i do see the device on my tablet and phone but it only show the mac address for the device and not the pt810 name like the other one show i be unable to connect to the device that show the mac address but i be able to successfully connect to the pt810 device and stream audio 3 i try it out in my truck on the way to work it work fine but like other have say in other review this device seem to block any bass for realequency so the sound quality over the speaker seem to be a little tinny and weak 4 i do not really fault the device on this one but i do get some ground loop feedback while it plug into a usb power source in my truck however almost everything do this when power by a 12v plug even my android phone which be not a cheaply make item overall i expect a little more for realom something so braindead simple a a bluetooth audio receiver i do find it a little comical read the include instruction with the huge and obvious spelling mistake and poor grammar ill cut this one a a loss but maybe i can find some unique use for the one work device if the company want to replace my doa device for for realee i will gladly accept but otherwise my 2 for 5 become a 1 for 10 that s ok i ve order a few item for realom china and while the quality be questionable i ve be happy with what i have receive for the price,Bad
very nice telescope telescope be small and lightweight it really zoom in great have you can see for realom picture set up be simple i just download app on my desktop and follow on screen instruction i recieve this item at a discount in exchange for a review,Good
for the money this be definitely a solid buy and the review comment on how small this be be true the picture do make it look much large than it be but it be indeed fain real lifey small and very light one thing that be a bit of a bummer be it capacity and spikey transfer rate and that be the reason for the 4 star instead of five i own a pny turbo 128 gb drive and the storage capacity for that drive be 124 gb which honestly surprise i how close it be to be a true 128 gb but this sandisk drive be only 115 gb the loss of 9 gb and the high price of this compare to the pny turbo be a bit of a let down the transfer rate of this unit be fast than the pny turbo but only when the rate be not spike which happen a lot with this drive i have have lot of random drop in datum write on large file on this drive a where the pny turbo be more stable but slow i have also notice that the brush aluminum finish be a bit prone to scratch a well after minimal use overall i like the new flair series i just wish that they would increase the actual capacity a bit more and that write speed would be stable truly i would rate this a 35 star if i could but i figure i would round up instead,Average
work perfectly on my computer but on my phone i have not try it yet speed and write speed be spectacular,Good
buy this thinking it would be a bit of a task to put the my old drive in it i be wrong it basically 3 part the body the coverboard and 2 screw you plug in the coverboard to the drive slide the drive into the enclosure and place the two screw 0 and you re do i reformatte the drive a it have an o on it since i replace my macbook drive with a 500 gb drive for 1499 i have a portable 250 gb drive awesome the enclosure use use mini usb the cable supply have miniusb on one end and two usb 20 connection on the other this be cool if you have an old mac or a pc that have a usb port that do not supply enough power to run the drive the new mac only need one to make this one spin but it good they provide it to ensure no problem with other machine note one thing to note if you have never erase a drive with an o on it i have to figure this out disk utoday i learnedity would not just let i reformat the drive because many of the file where protect so i drag the folder and file into the trash then optiondelete to delete all the file once they be go it reformatte just fine hope that help,Good

i be probably say the same thing that at least 2610 other reviewer have state this thing work great for what you need i be a passionate photographer and my computer only have four for realontend usb port i need two for the keyboard and mouse alone another for my phone and another for my transfer cable for realom camera to computer i get tired of have to unplug one device for another and then forget to plug the device back in a blue light come on when a usb port be active but a button press by the port can shut that port off this little gadget be a great deal at the current price,Good
i get a great deal on a new retina imac 27inch during an easter sale but unfortunately it come with the 1 tb standard hard drive which be super slow 100130mbsecond read time to add an ssd on an imac be crazy expensive with apple i buy this drive clone my o x internal drive to it the 512 gb model and my computer now behave like it have an ssd for a for realaction of the price it support uasp which be critical for i well see how it last but right now the difference this make in the computer a a boot drive mean it no long take 20second to open lightroom but instead 45 second with a huge library of 90k photo accord to disk speed test i see right around 390mbs write and 425mbs read over usb 30,Good

i purchase two adata uv12832 gb usb 30 dashdrives for realom another online retailer while they be on sale but i be so impressed with they i think i d post a quick review a well a an image of a speed test i have a box of about more than a dozen thumb drive of all size and wellknown brand most be six month to two year old this adata dashdrive be the late usb 30 spec however my computer an imac that s a couple of year old be usb 20 to date the adata drive be the fast i ve use particularly when it come to write speed write average be about 19mbs and read be about 34mbs the write speed be a much a double some of the other flash drive that i have my computer have an internal ssd flash drive and even though it usb 20 spec move file tofor realom the adata be very quick i be able to transfer about 15gbs for realom my computer to the adata drive in le than 15 minute the adata form factor be fain real lifey normal with a lock slide expose and conceal the usb connector it do a good job of lock in place when open which can be an issue for similar drive the build feel solid and i d expect it to last a good long time i ve be use two of these adata drive for about a week now and so far i m very happy and can recommend it if something should change ill be sure to post an update,Good
i ve use this docking bay for a few hour and with a few hard drive transfer so i be confident that i be able to comment on it at this point first a you will notice the packaging be quite superb bright and clear photo display the product a show in this picture and all the feature be clear i really love how this have an offline clone function just a easy a make a photocopy with the press of a button you be do area for improvement some small area of improvement i hook this drive up to a meter that measure the trasnfer speed and i be not quite able to get up to 5 gbps a advertise it hover around 4 or 45 most of the time i be not certain a to why this be but want to share it to the extent someone find it good to know i would also prefer if the button on the for realont be a bit easy to depress a it seem to get stuck sometimes despite these few area of improvement i stoday i learnedl think this be a 5 star product work well and very durable,Good
i put one of these in my fishing boat last summer and it be great the amfm radio be surprisingly good but the no more skip cd feature of the mechless drive be what make this a great little outfit for a boat or offor reaload vehicle the marine radio it replace cost 3 time a much the cd player be shoot after one season of bounce around and the radio do not even have any memory it also have a line in jack so a short cable to my laptop and i have access to hundred of hour worth of mp3s my only gripe be it do not read mp3 id tag so you do not really know what s play but want do you expect for under 40 buck update like a lot of other people i experience the no light on display recently may 2014 since i contract refurb work on electronic i do a little troubleshooting and find a bad transistor which bring the light back but there be nothing on the display and the mp3 decoder chip be hot than a pistol i see all they sell be refurb now and this be obviously why although it do not last a long a i have hope i can not say that i do not get my money worth i have it just shy of 4 year so i can not complain for 10 buck a year,Good
